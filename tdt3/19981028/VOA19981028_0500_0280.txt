Powerful hurricane Mitch continues to pound the Northwest and Caribbean 
and Central American coastline with damaging winds and torrential 
rain. VOA's Greg Flakess is riding out the storm in Mexico City and 
updates us in this report. Officials from Nicaragua and Honduras to 
northern Yukatan are evacuating people from low-lying areas where 
rains have already produced flooding. The 35 kilometer and diameter 
eye of the hurricane is moving slowly northwest at about nine kilometers 
an hour. If the storm trackers' calculations are correct, Mitch will 
drift over Mexico's Yukatan Peninsula some time in the next three 
days. However, meteorologists caution such storms can change course 
unexpectedly. The governor of the Mexican state of Cantanarow, Mario 
DiAnwela, says he's preparing for the worse, assuming that the eye 
of the storm will strike his state in the eastern part of Yukatan 
in the coming hours. He says as many as 20,000 people may be evacuate 
to protect them from floods and high winds. Greg Flakess, VOA News, 
Mexico City. And I'm Mimani Crosby, VOA News, Washington. This is 
"VOA News Now." Broadcasting from Washington, I'm Charlene Porter 
along with Paul Westfeeling.
