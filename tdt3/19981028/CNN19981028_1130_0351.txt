The ACLU is encouraging high school students to exercise their rights 
to free speech, privacy and nondiscrimination. Greg Lefevre reports 
some call it encouraging defiance, others say it's the american way. 
In the cradle of the free speech movement, the American civil liberties 
union teaches high school students about free speech on campus, about 
rights and about responsibilities. It teaches you how to use your 
rights without abusing your rights. Example, when to call a student 
strike, its effects and side effects. If you leave the school, what 
are they going to do? They're eventually going to have to change things 
for the students. That's the point of walkouts. To some this might 
be called "student rabble rousing 101." But to the organizers, it's 
more like "good student citizenship 102." More than 1,000 students 
attend, with the approval of their schools. Many are student journalists 
flexing their first amendment wings, asking about publishing controversial 
articles. We can put that in there, but there's also certain limits 
that we have to follow. The one-day course also covered student searches, 
gay rights, race and discipline. Is vast majority of kids are great 
and there are very few kids who are troublemakers. They learn the 
power of positive schmoozing. They are much more likely to give you 
something if they want to give it to you, if you ask politely than 
if you command it from them. When to raise a ruckus. What's helpful 
is when you have a situation in which the school acts unreasonably. 
Again, there's two different sides to it, the pros and the cons. It 
really helps you to figure out what kind of stand you can take, that 
they just don't get angry and do something that might get them in 
further trouble. I'm seeing things from a real liberal viewpoint, 
and me being a Conservative it's kind helpful to see both sides of 
the issue. Although not necessarily converting. Greg Lefevre, CNN, 
Berkeley.
