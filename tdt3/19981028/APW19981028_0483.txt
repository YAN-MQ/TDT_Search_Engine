Thirty-four people were killed and 20 others wounded in an overnight 
attack south of Burundi's capital, the state-owned Radio Burundi reported 
Wednesday. The broadcast did not say who was responsible for the attack 
but said the number of casualties was likely to rise. It gave no explanation. 
The attack on the Nyamaboko and Kiyenzi neighborhoods, about 15 kilometers 
(10 miles) south of Bujumbura, was the first serious slaughter since 
a third round of talks to stop the bloodletting ended Oct. 22 in the 
northern Tanzania town of Arusha. After 10 days of talks representatives 
of 18 political parties chose Italian priest Mathias Zuppi, who has 
been involved in mediation efforts in Angola and Mozambique, to head 
a panel to discuss security issues in Burundi. Zuppi is to present 
his report when peace negotiations resume Jan. 18. Hutu rebels are 
fighting to topple the military government of Pierre Buyoya, a member 
of the Tutsi minority that accounts for 14 percent of Burundi's population 
of 6 million. Hutus make up 85 percent. At the same time, soldiers 
in the Tutsi-dominated military are known to kill Hutu civilians in 
retaliation for rebel attacks, especially those on Tutsi civilians 
and army patrols and outposts. More than 200,000 people have been 
killed in violence that broke out in Burundi in October 1993 after 
Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Burundi's first democratically elected 
president, Melchoir Ndadaye, a Hutu.
