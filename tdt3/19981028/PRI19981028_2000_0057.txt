From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff, 
The Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Henry Hyde, 
there is little doubt President Clinton Committed Perjury while testifying 
before a grand jury about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Hyde 
leads the probe into the possible impeachment of the president. NPRs 
David Wilnor reports from Chicago. A newspaper from Henry Hyde's suburban 
Chicago district is quoting him as saying, there is not much doubt 
that President "did willfully misstate the facts under oath," when 
questioned in August by a team of lawyers working with Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr. Hyde has said before that he considers perjury 
a serious offense for which 115 people are currently in prison in 
the US. But Hyde, who recently acknowledged having himself had an 
extra-marital affair with a married women when he was in his forties, 
insists he does not want to oust the President. The paper quotes him 
as saying, the last thing he wants to do is impeach a president. Hyde 
says he is not a Clinton hater, nor does he admire the President. 
Impeachment hearings he'll preside over are to begin in two weeks.
