The world population is expected to increase by 50 percent over the 
next half-century despite falling fertility rates and the rising mortality 
rate from AIDS. Those are the findings of a top United Nations researcher 
as we hear from our U.N. correspondent Max Ruston. A new U.N. report 
on population trends says the world population currently stands at 
5.9 billion. It is expected to reach six billion by this time next 
year an nine billion by the middle of the next century. An exponential 
rise in the number of older people,particularly in developed nations, 
will contribute to this trend, but experts say the growth rate would 
be much higher if not for two factors, AIDS and declining fertility. 
In the countries in Africa worst hit by AIDS, life expectancy rates 
will be seven years lower than they would have been in the absence 
of AIDS. And U.N. officials say fertility rates have plummeted around 
the world and, in some countries, are now below the level needed to 
replace generations. Max Ruston, VOA News, United Nations.
