Super Bowl XXXVI on Jan. 27, 2002, will be played in the Superdome 
in New Orleans. The National Football League owners chose that city 
Wednesday over the other finalist, San Diego, but said that San Diego 
would be favored to be the host in 2004. Thus, the next five Super 
Bowls will be played in Miami (1999), Atlanta (2000), Tampa Bay (2001), 
New Orleans (2002) and San Francisco (2003). ``We had a great presentation 
and so did San Diego but New Orleans is a city that sells itself,'' 
said Saints owner Tom Benson. ``We'll have 17,000 downtown hotel rooms 
and nearly everything will be in walking distance to the game. It 
was New Orleans' time. It was New Orleans' turn.'' In other news here 
at the NFL owners annual fall meeting, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue 
said that the committee studying expansion will be expanded. The new 
group will be led by New England Patriots' owner Robert Kraft and 
Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson. Three groups _ one from 
Houston and two from Los Angeles _ are vying for the NFL's next expansion 
team. Cleveland next season becomes the league's 31st franchise and 
the league would like to add a 32nd franchise to begin play in 2002. 
Those three group want that spot and the new committee will study 
their financing and stadium options and will set a franchise fee. 
The Cleveland franchise, the latest purchased, cost $473 million. 
Tagliabue said the new franchise would cost at least that and likely 
more. ``Both Los Angeles and Houston are very important to the league 
not just as the two cities but because of the regions,'' said Tagliabue. 
``In each case, we do not have a football team in regions of the country 
where there is a strong interest in the game.''
