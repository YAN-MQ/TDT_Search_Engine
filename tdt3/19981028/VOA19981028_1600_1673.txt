Talk about the tax man coming. In a suburb of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 
Vito Caposhus and his wife will owe about $5,000 in property tax on 
their house. That's a lot of money, but they're relieved. It could 
have been much worse. Local officials say that, because of computer 
error, the first Caposhus property tax bill was for about $43,000. 
According to their mistaken tax assessment, their home was worth more 
than a million dollars, and the tax bill showed the couple had installed 
250 new fireplaces in the house. In fact, they don't even have one 
fireplace. It seems to me when the tax people scare you that much, 
they shouldn't charge you anything -- you know, just for the fright 
of it all. I think they ought to show up and count all the fireplaces 
myself.
