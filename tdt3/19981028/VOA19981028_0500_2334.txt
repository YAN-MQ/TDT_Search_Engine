Gerhart Schroeder has held his first cabinet meeting after being sworn 
into office as the new chancellor of Germany. Mr. Schroeder and his 
cabinet approved a decision to send 200 unarmed German observers to 
Kosovo to help monitor the withdrawal of Serbian forces. The new chancellor 
shares power in a coalition government with the environmentalist Greens 
party, Germany's first center-left coalition in 16 years. Suzanne 
Kelly in Bonn reports on Mr. Schroeder's swearing-in ceremony held 
just a few hours after parliament voted to make him Germany's seventh 
post-war leader. Since he was a young man, this is a day that Gerhart 
Schroeder has dreamed of. He says that in his youth he once shook 
the gates of the Chancellery, demanding to be let in. That day finally 
came Tuesday. Gerhart Schroeder was elected by the lower house of 
parliament on Tuesday and sworn in as Germany's seventh post-war chancellor. 
His administration is sure to mark a distinctive difference from the 
conservative government of Helmut Kohl. Mr. Schroeder's coalition 
with the environmental Greens party is the first left-of-center government 
in Germany in 16 years. Mr. Schroeder is wasting no time in getting 
to the country's business at hand. His first cabinet meeting was to 
take place Tuesday evening. The topics of discussion were sure to 
include ways to tackle Germany's high unemployment level, now above 
10 percent, as well as another issue long-resisted by the previous 
conservative rule: updating Germany's immigration policy. Germany 
is the world's third-largest economy. And the business-friendly Mr. 
Schroeder has promised to remain a friend to big business, but his 
powerful finance minister, Oscar LaFonatne, is closer to the old left-wing 
of the party. The German news media has already speculated about a 
power struggle between the two men, a report that both men deny. Mr. 
Schroeder will be the last chancellor to serve from Bonn. He says 
he is looking for ways to speed the government's move from Bonn to 
Berlin next year. Suzanne Kelly for VOA News, Bonn.
