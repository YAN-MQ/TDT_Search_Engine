Iran has imprisoned a group of black market money dealers and fined 
them 490 billion rials (dlrs 163 million) for buying and selling foreign 
currency, Iranian television reported Wednesday. It did not say how 
many people were arrested or give details on the crime or the prison 
sentences. It also did not give the dates of the arrests. ``The members 
of the gang had sabotaged the country's economic system and have been 
given prison sentences as well as a fine,'' the broadcast quoted an 
official as saying. Iran nationalized its banking sector in 1979 and 
forbids currency trading outside official channels. The official exchange 
rate is 3,000 rials to the dollar, but the dollar sells for some 6,500 
rials on the black market. Black market currency traders are easy 
to find on busy streets in downtown Tehran. The government has been 
trying to eradicate the black market for years.
