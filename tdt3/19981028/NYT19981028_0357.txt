This summer I wrote two columns about a man named Jeffrey Blake, who 
was serving a term of 36 years to life in prison for the murder of 
two men in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1990. It was a spectacular and brazen 
crime, an execution in broad daylight. The victims were in a car. 
They were killed by a gunman who ran beside the car and riddled them 
with bullets from an Uzi as they tried to get away by backing down 
the street. The car crashed into a building and the gunman fled. A 
man who claimed to be an eyewitness told authorities that Blake was 
the gunman. On the basis of his testimony, and his testimony alone, 
Blake was convicted. It turned out that it was almost physically impossible 
for Blake to have committed the murders. He was at work that day in 
the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, about 4.5 miles away. 
And while the murders took place about 1:45 p.m., during his 45-minute 
lunch break, it is highly unlikely that he could have traveled the 
requisite distance through busy Brooklyn neighborhoods, ambushed and 
executed the two men, disposed of the murder weapon and returned to 
work as if nothing had happened by 2 p.m., which is when his boss 
and co-workers said he came back from lunch. It also turned out that 
the ``eyewitness,'' a flake and chronic liar named Dana Garner, had 
witnessed nothing. His girlfriend, Margaret Allen, who was supposed 
to have witnessed the murders with him, said in a sworn affidavit 
in July that she hadn't seen those murders ``nor any other murder.'' 
She added, ``I would remember a murder if I had seen one.'' Blake 
recanted several months ago and when he was hooked up to a polygraph 
machine, he passed. I wrote in August that the case against Jeffrey 
Blake ``was virtually nonexistent'' and that it was unlikely that 
Dana Garner was even in New York when the murders were committed. 
Wednesday the district attorney for Brooklyn, Charles Hynes, said 
he agreed. He directed his office to join in a motion, filed by Blake's 
attorney, Michele Fox of the Legal Aid Society, to set aside the guilty 
verdict. He said Blake should be released from prison. That could 
happen as early as Thursday. Blake's appeals had been exhausted, and 
Hynes was under no obligation to reopen the case. But Ms. Fox continued 
her diligent efforts to prove her client innocent. After the columns 
ran, the DA's office conducted a new investigation. ``We are convinced,'' 
said Deputy District Attorney Dennis Hawkins, ``that the evidence 
that Legal Aid has found and that we've discovered in our own independent 
investigation _ if it had been revealed at the time of the trial, 
Jeffrey Blake probably would not have been convicted.'' What usually 
happens in such cases, he said, is that the judge _ in this instance 
Supreme Court Justice Robert Kreindler _ would vacate the guilty verdict 
and order a new trial. But the DA's office will not pursue another 
trial. Hawkins said, ``Since we do not think that would be the fair 
thing to do, we would at that point dismiss the indictment against 
Blake.'' Blake learned of the new developments on Tuesday night, when 
he called his attorney from the maximum-security Green Haven prison 
in upstate New York. Ms. Fox said: ``It was so wonderful to be able 
to tell him, `Jeffrey, you're coming home.' He was so happy. He said, 
`Yes-s-s.''' Ms. Fox's feelings are mixed. She had spent several years 
working on appeals, convinced that her client was not only innocent 
but a decent person. ``It's gratifying that things finally worked 
out,'' she said. ``I'm grateful to the DA's office for finally looking 
at the case again and reinvestigating. But it saddens me that my guy 
had to give up eight years of his life before this happened.'' Hynes 
said he was ``relieved that this thing has been uncovered and this 
guy is going to walk out of jail after serving eight unnecessary years.'' 
He reflected for a moment on the time when he had been a defense lawyer, 
and said: ``The thing that scares the hell out of the better lawyers 
_ and I like to think I was one of them _ is representing someone 
who is innocent. In this case, not only was there an alibi that was 
rejected by the jury, but Garner's cousin, who was described to me 
as a spit-and-polish young Marine who was very believable, testified 
that Garner was not even in town, and the jury rejected that. I'm 
relieved that we were able to find other witnesses to confirm what 
the cousin said.'' Meanwhile, there remains the problem of who committed 
the murders. Hawkins, the deputy district attorney, said he and others 
were now faced with the task of finding the real killers.
