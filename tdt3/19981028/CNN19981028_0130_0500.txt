With a look at your "CNN Headline News Weather," I'm Karen McGinnis. 
High pressure is still in control across the southeastern United States 
and the mid-atlantic. Very little in the way of wet weather expected 
for the next several days. However, in the central plains we finally 
start to see the movement of a Storm system out of the southwestern 
quadrant to the U.S. -- snow levels lower behind the frontal system, 
we may see some showers and storms along the frontal boundary. Look 
for mostly 50s all the way from New England into the great basin, 
where higher elevations will be much cooler. Very mild 70s and 80s 
along the gulf coast and the southeast. Expect around 38 in Anchorage, 
Alaska, and just about 84 for San Juan. In our extended forecast -- 
rainy and windy in New England for Thursday, the midwest is unsettled. 
Going into Friday, showers and storms are possible in the southwest. 
Lots of 40s across the northern tier states. And then by Saturday, 
more rain expected for the pacific northwest. If you are looking for 
more weather information, you can log on to CNN.com for four-day forecasts.
