Five-thousand students demonstrated around Jircada in anti-government 
protests Wednesday. From the Indonesian capital, Jenny Grant reports 
the students forced their way to the front of the parliament after 
being held off for hours by soldiers. Lines of soldiers armed with 
tear gas and semi-automatic weapons at first held off two separate 
groups of protesters numbering as many as three-thousand. They tried 
unsuccessfully to prevent the students from demonstrating at the parliament, 
now a symbol of the uncertain past to Indonesia's new democracy. First 
the students, many wearing colored jackets from their universities, 
ripped off barbed wire attached to a toll-road fence in front of the 
parliament, then tore the barrier down. Police blocked 14 lanes of 
traffic on Jircada's busiest ring-road, causing traffic chaos throughout 
the city of 11 million people. Elsewhere in the city 2,000 other students 
demonstrated at two university campuses. The gatherings coincided 
with National Youth Pledge Day, which celebrates the 1928 founding 
by Indonesian youth of a nationalist movement against Dutch colonial 
rule. The students urged President Beejay Habbibey to resign, calling 
him a crony of former President Soohatar. Mr. Soohatar was forced 
from power in May, following widespread riots and student protests. 
The students from more than 20 universities across Indonesia are calling 
for a transitional coalition to run the country before general elections 
next May. The students also say they want the military to give up 
its roll in civilian government affairs, which gives it a hand in 
national politics. Four military water cannon trucks were parked at 
the gates of the parliament but were not used. In unrelated protests, 
supporters of opposition leader Maygawatti Sucarno Poortrey drove 
convoys of more than 100 cars and motor bikes around the city./ Her 
supporters want Ms. Maygawatti to compete at elections next year and 
become the new president. This is Jenny Grant reporting for VOA News, 
Jicarda.
