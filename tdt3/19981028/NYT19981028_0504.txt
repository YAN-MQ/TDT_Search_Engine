Lord Sainsbury of Drury Lane, who revolutionized the retail food industry 
in Britain, transforming his family's grocery business into the country's 
first modern, self-service supermarket empire and forever changing 
the shopping habits of the average Briton, died Oct. 21. He was 96. 
When Alan Sainsbury, as he was called then, and his brother, Robert, 
took over the family business in 1938, it was a chain of small grocery 
stores run in the traditional way: The customer selected the products 
and the grocer took them off the shelves and packed them up. But, 
inspired by a trip to America in which he saw his first supermarket, 
Lord Sainsbury decided that the future lay in self service. It was 
a breathtaking idea, but not everyone was thrilled to be on the cutting 
edge of grocery innovation. In 1950, when the first new-style store 
opened, in Croydon, Lord Sainsbury stood at the front door, handing 
out wire shopping baskets. One customer threw her basket back at him 
in a fury. Another customer, the wife of a judge, shouted that she 
did not want to do the job of a shop assistant. Meanwhile, competitors 
ridiculed the idea and said it would never catch on. ``How wrong they 
were,'' Lord Sainsbury said later, ``and how lucky we were that they 
were wrong.'' Alan John Sainsbury was born in Hampstead, London, in 
1902, into a family that had been in the grocery business for more 
than 30 years. From its humble beginning as a shop selling dairy products 
on Drury Lane in London, the first Sainsbury's had grown to a chain 
of 250 stores across the south of England. Lord Sainsbury's father, 
John, served as the company's chairman until he died in 1956, though 
he ceded much of his power to his sons in 1938. Lord Sainsbury joined 
the business in 1921, explaining, ``My mother said it would break 
my father's heart if I didn't.'' He served behind the counter at the 
Boscombe branch, using an assumed name, and worked in the dairy department 
under the supervision of his uncles, Arthur and Alfred. At that time, 
only family members were allowed to buy eggs and milk for the stores. 
He moved quickly up the ranks, serving with his brother as joint general 
manager. Lord Sainsbury, then known by everyone as ``Mr. Alan,'' was 
in charge of the retail side of the business; his brother handled 
the finances and administration. After World War II, Lord Sainsbury 
traveled to the United States on a fact-finding mission to learn about 
frozen food. It was then that he had an epiphany. Confronted by his 
first supermarket, he said, he was ``thrilled and stimulated by the 
potentiality of self-service trading.'' Despite lean times in the 
postwar years, when widespread shortages and strict rationing depressed 
the food industry, the brothers went on to preside over an enormous 
expansion, opening new stores that were bigger and more sensitive 
to customer convenience than ever before. Lord Sainsbury brought in 
fresh produce and frozen foods; revolutionized packaging so that the 
product became the ``silent salesman''; promoted the company's ``own-label'' 
foods, which were sold under the Sainsbury's brand, and pushed the 
concept of low-cost, high-quality foods under the slogan, ``Good Food 
Costs Less at Sainsbury's.'' When it went public in 1973, the company 
was worth 117 million pounds; today, sales in the chain of supermarkets 
runs more than 12 billion pounds ($20 billion) a year. A perennial 
loser as a political candidate, Lord Sainsbury was made a life peer 
in 1962, an appointment that enabled him to join the House of Lords. 
Initially a member of the Labor Party, he switched to the Liberal 
Democratic Party but remained fiercely independent. He was an active 
participant in the business of the House of Lords _ ``I'm part of 
the furniture,'' he said _ as well as working as an advocate for the 
food retail industry and serving on numerous food-related public committees 
and government advisory boards. He also campaigned for social welfare 
and liberal causes and gave generously to a range of charities, particularly 
those helping underprivileged children. A childhood of rejection from 
the British upper classes _ his mother was Jewish and his father was 
``in trade,'' as Britons of the time disparagingly called even grocery 
magnates _ left him with a lifelong distrust of snobbery and of the 
British class system and a strong belief in the philanthropic uses 
of wealth. Although he retired in 1967, when he was appointed life 
president of Sainsbury's, Lord Sainsbury never stopped going to his 
office at the firm, which had changed almost beyond recognition in 
his more than 75 years in the business. When he started, Sainsbury's 
carried 50 items and made deliveries by horse and cart; now its stores 
stock more than 23,000 products and accept orders over the Internet. 
Married in 1925, Lord Sainsbury divorced his wife 14 years later and 
married again in 1944. He outlived both wives. He is survived by three 
sons, a daughter and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
