The body that has been looking into the crimes of South Africa's apartheid 
era, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is facing legal moves, 
as it prepares to publish its final report. Both sides of the struggle 
want sections that criticize them to be amended. The BBC's Greg Barrow 
has more. Just 24 hours before the commission's report was due to 
be made public, South Africa's last apartheid president, F. W. deKlerk 
succeeded in getting sections which contained damaging allegations 
of his knowledge of state sponsored bombing campaigns removed. Now 
the African National Congress says, it is also taking court action 
to prevent publication of a section of the commission report accusing 
it of gross human rights violations during the apartheid era. If more 
political parties follow this lead of taking court action, the contents 
of the report will have been effectively censored. And the credibility 
of the Truth Commission will be in tatters. Greg Barrow in Johannesburg.
