Sophia Loren says she is taking her doctor's orders seriously, but 
that doesn't stop her from joking about her heart. The actress, 64, 
fell ill on an Aug. 10 flight from Geneva, Switzerland, to New York, 
where she was diagnosed as having an irregular heartbeat and hospitalized 
for a few days. Now she's back at home in Geneva, where she has been 
spotted taking a walk in a botanical garden. After a telephone interview 
with Rome's La Repubblica daily, the newspaper quoted Loren as saying 
the doctor had ordered her to take brisk walks _ ``every day making 
a little bigger effort.'' Otherwise, she is taking things more slowly, 
the actress said in the interview, which ran Wednesday. ``I'll take 
airplanes less, I'll work less, I'll do everything to avoid every 
stress .... I'll learn to stay calm, I'll ruthlessly avoid all kinds 
of emotions, any apprehension,'' said Loren, playing on the Italian 
word for ``apprehension,'' which can also mean ``heartthrob.'' ``Unfortunately, 
I won't be able to fall in love again,'' she said, laughing, ``because 
I care more about my heart than about a fantastic heartthrob.'' Loren 
said she would return to the United States in January to promote her 
new book combining memoirs and recipes.
