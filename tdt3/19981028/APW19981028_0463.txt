Government troops cordoned off a village in India's northern Kashmir 
state Wednesday where a fierce gun battle was being fought with separatist 
militants, police said. Five militants were killed in the fighting. 
Some of the militants stormed into a policeman's house in the village 
of Satra and took his three children hostage. But government soldiers 
rescued the children after a prolonged exchange of fire, said a police 
official on condition of anonymity. Earlier, police and army soldiers 
surrounded the village in the border district of Poonch after receiving 
information that militants were hiding there. The militants opened 
fire at the approaching soldiers. Even while the battle was continuing, 
police claimed five militants had been killed. There were no immediate 
details about government casualties. India says militants frequently 
cross the border to infiltrate fighters and weapons into Kashmir, 
where an armed insurrection against Indian rule has been under way 
since 1989. About 15,000 people have been killed. Kashmiris, who are 
mostly Muslims, are fighting for independence from predominantly Hindu 
India or to merge the disputed territory with neighboring Pakistan, 
an officially Islamic nation.
