From Frankenstein to dracula, moviegoers usually jump out of their 
seats while watching horror films. There are people behind the scenes 
who add terror to those movies with their tunes. Dennis Michael introduces 
us to one such composer. It doesn't take long to determine what kind 
of music this is. Film composer Christopher young does all sorts of 
film scores. His music recently underlined the action in "rounders" 
and "the man who knew too little" and "hard rain." But he started 
out in -- and feels very comfortable doing -- horror film scores. 
The music and the macabre both go back to his childhood. Hanging on 
the wall in my bedroom were not only photos of the Beatles, but right 
alongside, Lugosi as dracula, Karloff as Frankenstein. I've always 
had a passion for halloween. Where did it come from? Lord knows. Now, 
where were we? Christopher young created the demonic soundtrack for 
the "Hellraiser" movies of clive Barker and for the erotic interplanetary 
evil of the "species" films. Young says when you're writing music 
that's intended to terrify, things like melody and subtlety are left 
behind. You get to be extremely aggressive. You don't have to worry 
about reserving yourself, about stepping on the picture, of saying 
too much. In horror films, quite the contrary, you're encouraged to 
just dive at the audience with your music. If you're doing your job 
properly as a composer, you can make the audience jump out of their 
chairs. That says something to you in a way that a nice little melody 
doesn't say. It hits you in the gut in the way nothing pretty that 
you would play in C major would. He still has pictures of the classic 
universal studios monsters on the walls of his studio, but now they're 
autographed. They're part of his extensive collection of halloween 
memorabilia. He's particularly fond of Jack-O'-lantern masks -- the 
more demented, the better. I have about 25 to date. It's hard to track 
down how many have been made over the years, but it's an ongoing thing. 
And hopefully, in a certain period of time, I'll have them all. Christopher 
young isn't going to limit himself to horror scores in the future, 
by any means. But when he does compose the music for something frightening, 
he knows the first rule. C major? huh-uh. Dennis Michael, "CNN Entertainment 
News," Hollywood.
