We are back live tonight at the Kennedy space center in Florida where 
our coverage of tomorrow's shuttle launch will continue in a moment. 
First, though, tonight, a major story out of Moscow today, president 
yeltsin's spokesman announced the Russian president would be turning 
over day-to-day responsibility to running the government to Yevgeny 
Primakov prim. Yeltsin entered a hospital outside Moscow yesterday. 
The Kremlin says he's suffering from exhaustion. It's not clear yet 
when he will return to work, but his spokesman insists he will serve 
out the remaining two years of his term.
