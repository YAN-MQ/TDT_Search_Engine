In 1976, when US record buyers were grabbing everything they could 
get from Jamaican Reggae pioneer Bob Marley, back in his home land, 
the Abyssinians released an album that would take 13 years to get 
here. It was titled, "Santa Mosangana" or "Forward to Zion" in Ammarik, 
the Ethiopian language. The Abyssinians were among Jamaica's first 
hit makers to sing in Ammarik, a point that caused the Rostaffari 
community there, with its back to Africa credo, to consider the band 
the authentic musical article. Donald Manning, the founder of the 
Abyssinians teaches Ammarik to other Reggae musicians in Kingston. 
Even though commercial pressures keep most of them singing in English. 
In fact, even the Abyssinians are subject to those pressures. We sent 
remixes of the title track of "Santa Mosangana" and another tune, 
"Zion Eye". I put the emphasis on the music, relegating the Ammarik 
words to the back burner. Music from Jamaica's Abyssinians brings 
this addition of the program to a close. You can find out about the 
Abyssinians and other stories of the day on-line at www.theworld.org. 
In Boston, I'm Tony Conn inviting you to join us again tomorrow for 
another spin of The World.
