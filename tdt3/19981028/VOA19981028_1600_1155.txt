The top two mens tennis players in the world, Pete Sampras of the 
United States and Marcello Rias of Chile, have reached the second 
round of the Euro Card opening in Stutguard. The top-seated Sampras 
defeated German Nicholas Keefer 6-3, 6-4 today -- while number two 
Rias scored -- also beat a German in straight sets, defeating Tommy 
Haas 6-3 and 7-5. The home fans were pretty happy because Boris Becker 
recorded a huge upset before the partisan German fans, battling back 
to knock off four-seed Carlos Moya of Spain. The scores, 6-7, 6-4, 
and 6-4.
