A surprising turn in the struggle between farmers and crop pests has 
U.S. maze and soybean growers on the defensive. The U.S. Space Shuttle 
mission includes some unusual plant experiments. And a new twist of 
genetic engineering could mean better-tasting french fries. Rob Civic 
has the details in this week's edition of "Agriculture Briefs." In 
the age-old war between farmers and insect pests, the latest battle 
is being won by the bugs. U.S. farmers and pest management experts 
report a dramatic increase in damage to the nation's corn and soybean 
crops from the larvae of the Western Corn Rootworm Beetle. Forty years 
ago, the beetle developed resistance to the chemical pesticides farmers 
then used to control it. So growers turned to crop rotation. Instead 
of planting one maze crop after another, farmers followed each maze 
harvest with a planting of soybeans, a crop they knew the slow-moving 
rootworms would not eat. Crop rotation worked beautifully until now. 
It appears that through long periods of rotating the crop that a change 
in the pest is taking place by selecting some individuals that can 
survive in soybean fields. Larry Petago, a professor of entomology 
at Iowa State University, says Western Corn Rootworms have not only 
developed an appetite for tender soybeans, they are also laying their 
eggs in the soybean fields, threatening the maze crops to come. Many 
farmers are taking these pests with modern insecticides. But most 
growers know that the chemicals, and even the new corn variety being 
genetically engineered to resist the Rootworm, will be effective only 
until the insects learn to work around them. According to Professor 
Petago, we might win the next battle against the bugs, but the war 
itself can never be won.
