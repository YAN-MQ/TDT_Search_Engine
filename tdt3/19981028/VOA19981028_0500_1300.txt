Negotiators for National basketball players and team owners have agreed 
to meet throughout the week in an effort to resole their labor dispute. 
The two sides met for nearly nine hours Monday in New York City, but 
neither side seemed willing to budget on the salary cap issues. League 
commissioner David Stearn has already canceled the first two weeks 
of the NBA season, which was scheduled to start next week.
