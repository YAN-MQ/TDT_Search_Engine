A more immediate election is looming though congressional elections 
next tuesday. Wolf Blitzer reports, President Clinton is taking seriously 
his role as "Campaigner-in-chief." It was a winning tactic for President 
Clinton in getting re-elected in '96, scaring women and older Americans. 
And it's now come back only one week before the elections. At risk 
this time, the president says, is social security. The Senate majority 
leader has suggested that he may not even be willing to work with 
me to save social security. Well, I hope that's just election-season 
rhetoric. At a White House event on social security and women, the 
president took aim at Trent Lott and other republican leaders. They 
were willing to work with the insurance lobbyists to kill the patients 
bill of rights. And then they worked with the tobacco companies to 
kill our teen-smoking bill to protect our children from the dangers 
of tobacco. And they were happy to work with the special interests 
who were determined to kill campaign finance reform. I think the Senate 
majority leader will be able to find time to work with me to save 
social security. Lott later issued a statement saying -- but the White 
House continues to try to mobilize core democratic constituencies, 
warning that republican gains next week could also be disastrous for 
health care, education and the environment. There are vast differences. 
There are consequences. People need to understand that there are consequences 
to what happens on tuesday, and the way to have your voice heard is 
to get out and vote. Republican strategists insist this latest round 
of scare tactics underscores democratic desperation. Bill Clinton 
has a problem. He's the first president for 20 years who's so unpopular, 
he can't go out and campaign the last week before the elections. They've 
got him kind of locked up in the White House. Another loyal democratic 
group the president hopes to energize this week, African-American 
voters. On Wednesday, he'll focus on the impact of AIDS on the black 
community. And on Sunday, he'll attend a black church in Baltimore.
