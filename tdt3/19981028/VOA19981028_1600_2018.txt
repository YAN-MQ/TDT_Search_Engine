The United States says it is confident that Israel and the Palestinians 
will honor their new peace deal despite minor obstacles. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright spoke by phone with leaders of the two 
sides and was assured the accord will go forward. Israel's prime minister, 
Benjamin Netanyahu, has delayed presenting the land-for-security deal 
to a cabinet vote until the Palestinians submit a plan to fight terrorism. 
The United States expects to receive the Palestinian plan by Friday.
