A powerful regional politician was detained in a multimillion dollar 
corruption case Wednesday after he surrendered in court in the state 
considered India's most lawless. Laloo Prasad Yadav, former chief 
minister of Bihar state, has been charged with siphoning off millions 
of dollars in government funds during his tenure. Judge S.K. Lal ordered 
him held in ``judicial custody'' at a government guest house instead 
of a jail _ for security reasons _ during a hearing in the state's 
capital of Patna. Judge Lal gave no decision Wednesday on a bail petition 
moved by Yadav. The hearing will continue on Thursday, court officials 
said. Hundreds of Yadav's supporters beat drums, waved flags and shouted 
slogans against Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata 
Party as Yadav entered the courtroom. Yadav claims he was framed by 
federal investigators. He will be kept at the sprawling guest house 
of the Bihar's military police, officials said. Yadav was held there 
under similar conditions for two months last year, after which he 
complained he was suffering from heart ailments and was shifted to 
a hospital. Yadav was forced to quit the chief minister's position 
after being charged with corruption. He immediately appointed his 
wife chief minister and continues to wield enormous power from behind 
the scenes even as his trial continues.
