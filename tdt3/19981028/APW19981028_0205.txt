PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO is keeping more than 400 warplanes 
on alert to make sure that President Slobodan Milosevic continues 
to withdraw forces from Kosovo and allows tens of thousands of refugees 
to return home. A senior NATO general, Klaus Naumann of Germany, said 
Wednesday that the drawdown of Serb forces is not complete but moves 
so far represent a ``considerable step in the direction of fulfilling 
the demands.'' With Yugoslav forces drawing back, the Western military 
alliance did not set any new deadlines for airstrikes after the previous 
one expired Tuesday. That was a bitter disappointment to Kosovo's 
ethnic Albanian politicians, who had been hoping the Alliance would 
deliver a devastating air blow to the Yugoslav president's war machine. 
``Milosevic has known all along that NATO would not be bombing, that 
he would be getting away with what he and his military police have 
been doing here in Kosovo,'' Muhamet Hamiti of the Leage of Democratic 
Kosovo said Wednesday. ``NATO has been frightening itself for too 
long.'' But by warning that the threat of attack remains, NATO hoped 
to guarantee the safety of the ethnic Albanian refugees, who are terrified 
of returning home unless government troops and Serb police are held 
back. ``We know that President Milosevic only moves when he is presented 
with the credible threat of force,'' NATO Secretary-General Javier 
Solana told a news conference after a 2 1-2-hour meeting of NATO ambassadors 
in Brussels, Belgium. ``This crisis is far from over,'' he added. 
``I urge both sides to take advantage of the opportunity that now 
exists to move the political process forward.'' In an Oct. 12 peace 
deal, American negotiator Richard Holbrooke demanded that Milosevic 
cut the number of troops and police in Kosovo to the levels of last 
February, when Milosevic began his crackdown on the separatist Kosovo 
Liberation Army. Hundreds have died in the fighting and 300,000 ethnic 
Albanians have been forced from their homes. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 
2 million residents are ethnic Albanian, and most favor independence. 
Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia. In 
an interview Wednesday with Radio Germany, Gen. Naumann said Serb 
police had still not pulled out of one of eight locations they had 
agreed to leave. He said NATO would keep up the pressure to make sure 
there was no backsliding on Milosevic's part. U.S. Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright told reporters in Washington that NATO would move 
quickly to use force against Yugoslavia if Milosevic sends troops 
and special police back to Kosovo. Albright said the NATO allies were 
preparing to organize a rapid-reaction force based in the neighboring 
former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia that could intervene quickly 
and to protect -- if necessary -- the 2,000 unarmed personnel who 
will verify that Milosevic keeps his promises. A spokesman for the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is overseeing 
the verification mission, said Norwegian Gen. Bjorn Nygard was due 
in Pristina on Thursday to take charge of the operation. The spokesman, 
Mons Nyberg, said he ``hoped'' some of the verification personnel 
would arrive by the end of the week. International officials hope 
the continued pressure will encourage many refugees to return to the 
homes they were forced to flee when fighting between rebels and Serb 
security forces escalated earlier this year. Hugh Parmer of the U.S. 
Agency for International Development visited a number of Kosovo villages 
and towns. ``The biggest difference is the hope I saw in the peoples' 
eyes now compared to the fear I saw seven weeks ago,'' he said. ``It 
is still a difficult situation, but if these people go home we will 
have a manageable humanitarian situation. There should be no deaths 
in the winter.'' Many of the displaced people are camping in the woods 
and hills, fearful that Serb police will shoot at them if they tried 
to go back. In the village of Ostrozub, southwest of Pristina, Avdullah 
Krasniqi loaded up his farm wagon with his wife, kids and household 
goods and headed home Tuesday. The ethnic Albanian made his decision 
less out of confidence that NATO had forced an end to the crisis than 
the fact that it was getting colder by the day in his mountain refuge. 
``We spent three months in the mountains,'' Krasniqi said as family 
members in a wagon sat on a huge pile of carpets, kitchen utensils 
and other household goods, all pulled by the family tractor. ``It's 
very cold.'' The Krasniqis wanted very badly to go home, but they 
are still wary. ``We don't have any faith in Milosevic,'' he said, 
licking his thick dark mustache, and noting that his next-door neighbor 
was shot and killed on his doorstep.
