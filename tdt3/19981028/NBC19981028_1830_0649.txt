at the wrong time. I didn't need a wimpy laptop. I needed a desktop

talking to me?" Introducing your:)ware technology that grows with 
you. When you cl 1-800-gateway we can custom-build you a portable 
desktop with an Intel Pentium II processor and a dvd drive for movies. 
All for just $87 a month. And in two years you can trade it in toward

and let's talk about your:)ware from gateway. Enterprise rent-A-car
