John Glenn gets to sleep until 8:30 in the morning should he choose 
to. The last time he did this, the wakeup call came at 220k A.M. "the 
Miami herald," a story about all the rituals in the space program, 
the traditional steag and egg breakfast, the cake in the shape of 
the Vic that is presented to the astronauts. It is presented to the 
astronauts, but it is even eaten. That would be bad luck. And tradition 
requires the astronauts sulet up and play a game of cards before playing 
their craft, five cards given to have each astronaut, the one with 
the lowest total losing the hand and don't stop playing until the 
captain looses. Sometime tomorrow they will find time after the card 
game at 2:00 eastern time to get into the craft and leave the surface 
of the earth and go into earth's orbit, John Glenn will make history 
with his victory lap.
