While Japan's industrial output climbed 2.5 percent in September, 
it was less than economists had forecast. It was only the second hike 
in eight months. Peter Morgan of HSPC Securities in Tokyo outlines 
one of the reasons behind the lackluster increase. The weakest area 
is capital investment. And the -- if you look at machine orders, that 
kind of thing, it's still on a decline trend there. And that's essentially 
driven by the weakness of corporate profits and the sort of very gloomy 
outlook of Japanese firms at this point. And so I think that weakness 
is certainly going to continue well into next year. The prolonged 
slide in production has resulted in job and wage cuts to press in 
consumer spending, which accounts for 60 percent of all economic activity 
in Japan.
