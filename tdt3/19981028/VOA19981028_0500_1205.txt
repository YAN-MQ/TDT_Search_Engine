Well, speaking of the Fire, a few thousand people turned out in downtown 
Chicago Tuesday afternoon to honor the city's newest sports champions. 
More now from VOA's Michael Leeland. It was much smaller than any 
of the six championship rallies for basketball's Chicago Bulls, but 
Fire fans were just as enthusiastic, as they thanked this year's MLS 
champions for a job well done. Fire general manager Peter Wilt reminded 
the crowd this year's team made history, in becoming the first expansion 
team in any major sport to win a championship in its first season. 
One year ago, this team didn't even exist. Six months ago, six different 
editors of "Soccer America" magazine predicted the Chicago Fire would 
finish in last place. The Fire defeated two-time champion D.C. United 
2-0 Sunday to win the MLS title. Michael Leeland, VOA Sports, Chicago. 
One more note about the Chicago Fire: They're pointing toward a rare 
double, with a chance to win the U.S. Open Cup. Friday night the Fire 
will take on the Columbus Crew in the finals of the National Tournament 
for the Dewer Cup at Soldier Field in Chicago. That 85-year-old tournament 
had been lightly regarded until the MLS was formed three years ago, 
reviving the competition. The event is open to all U.S. pro and amateur 
teams, with the top 32 reaching the championship tournament. D.C. 
United won the MLS Cup and the Open Cup in 1996, and nearly repeated 
the double last year, but lost to Dalals in the Open final.
