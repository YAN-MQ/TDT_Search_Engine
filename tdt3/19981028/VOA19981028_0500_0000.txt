NATO ambassadors tell Yugoslav President Milosevich not to send new 
troops in Kosovo. A Chinese airliner has been hijacked to Taiwan by 
its pilot -- the first such hijacking in four years. The fate of the 
more than 100 people on board the plane has not been determined. Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's latest medical problems have many Kremlin 
watchers asking, "Who's in charge?" While Mr. Yeltsin's in the hospital, 
our Moscow bureau chief looks at a few scenarios. I'm Charlene Porter. 
And I'm Paul Westfeeling. Our continuing look at next week's national 
elections in the United States focuses on several races in the southeastern 
United States. These stories, sports, business, music and more in 
this hour of "VOA News now." The news is next.
