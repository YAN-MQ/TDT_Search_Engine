Robert Burns, VOA News. A British court has dismissed warrants under 
which former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet is being held. But 
Mr. Pinochet remains in custody pending an appeal. As VOA's Christine 
Pornel reports from London, British police arrested the former Chilean 
president on October 16 following an extradition request from Spain. 
In overturning the warrants issued on behalf of the Spanish government, 
the panel of three judges ruled that one country cannot prosecute 
the head of another for crimes committed elsewhere. The ruling raises 
questions over the validity of extradition treaties bought by other 
countries. Switzerland has backed Spain's allegations against Mr. 
Pinochet, pending a formal extradition request of its own in connection 
with the disappearance of a Swiss-Chilean student in 1977. And private 
prosecutions were being prepared by Chilean exiles in Sweden, France, 
and Britain. Mr. Pinochet remains in detention, pending an appeal 
of the judgment. The case is expected to be appealed to the House 
of Lords, which serves as Britain's highest court. Christine Pornel, 
VOA News, London.
