Scattered storms in the midwest and showers on the east coast. Florida 
is looking great. Sunshine, 78 to 80 degrees with light winds at launch 
time. Most of the south will be in 80 degree temperatures. 40's and 
50's in the northern tier states. 54 in Seattle. L.A., 67 tomorrow. 
Some showers in Minneapolis. 82, Dallas. 65 in Washington, D.C., and 
53 in Boston. As we go into the weekend and check out Saturday, trick 
or treaters, looks like nice weather in the east. It will be warm 
in the southern half of the country and hot in parts of california, 
a little chilly in the northern tier states. You need to bundle up. 
That's the weather around the nation. Have a good time tomorrow. Thank 
you.
