To politics tonight and some new numbers out today that shed light 
on the president's political fortunes prior to his arrival at the 
Kennedy space center in Florida tomorrow, as today arrived, so did 
the announcement of an air assault of sorts as we first told you last 
night in the final week fore the election, the republican party is 
spending $1 million on an advertising campaign aimed at making President 
Clinton the central issue and many of the tight congressional races 
around the country. But as NBC news White House correspondent David 
Bloom reports, the new NBC news/"Wall Street Journal" poll suggests 
the change in tactics could backfire on republicans. The republicans' 
tough new, nationwide TV ad campaign makes the case that mr. Clinton 
is untrustworthy and that balanced leadership demands a Republican 
Congress. Should we reward not telling the truth? That is the question 
of this election, reward Bill Clinton or vote republican? At the White 
House, President Clinton argued he should be, "judged on his whole 
record I. and accused republicans of distracting attention from social 
security. I'm not trying to sugar coat the fact I made a mistake and 
that I didn't want anybody to know about it. Vice President Gore call 
thed the republican ad blitz a in disperation. Attack going the president 
and investigating the president has become an obsession with the republicans. 
Nervous republicans do admit there's a danger the new ads could drive 
scandal weary voters to vote democrat. For example in a new NBC news/"Wall 
Street Journal" poll out tonight, 68% disapprove of the way congressional 
republicans have handled the Lewinsky matter, and 71% now lieve Mr. 
Clinton should not be impeached. But in close races, especially in 
the south, republican candidates like michael burkhold are only too 
happy to see ads that play up the scandal. Remember, it's your choice 
for balance, vote republican. I think the ad is going to bring out 
our base voters. People are frustrated with Bill Clinton. Tonight 
the White House is planning a counteroffensive but both sides admit 
the cash-strapped democrac party cannot match the republicans ad for 
ad. The president said he's trying to atone for his mistakes. David 
Bloom, NBC news, the White House.
