In Yugoslavia, a prisoner helps his jailer escape. Convicts line up 
to wash brains under a tap in China. A Gypsy fortune teller in Romania 
is reading the palm of a man _ but he has a hook instead of a hand. 
Cartoons with a bitter twist from 29 countries where freedoms are 
curbed _ China, Iran and Yugoslavia _ are on display at the week-long 
international black humor festival in Bucharest, home to some of the 
darkest laughs known to modern man. Cartoonists from the West pale 
in comparison, trying to be too clever or focusing on the frivolous. 
Black humor, say aficionados, combines intelligence, wit and a sense 
of cruelty. Its object is horror. ``It's a superior form of optimism. 
You go beyond (the horror),'' said theater director Alexandru Tocilescu 
visiting the exhibition of 250 drawings that opened Monday in Bucharest's 
Bulandra theater. Horia Patapievici, a Romanian philosopher and head 
of the nine-member jury which judged the 2,000 paintings and drawings, 
said: ``Either you identify with horror or, in black humor, you put 
a distance between you and it.'' Countries such as Iran, Ukraine and 
Russia have a closer relationship to tragedy, which is why their jokes 
pack a punch. Western countries haven't known any real horror since 
the Nazi era, he said. Painted in somber tones, the winning cartoon 
created by Bulgarian artist Stefan Despodov depicts a man reading 
a newspaper being punched by a man in a photograph on the front page. 
``The cartoon represents the aggression in the press of the ordinary 
citizen,'' said Patapievici. ``In Bulgaria, like Romania, the language 
of journalists is violent and cruel.''
