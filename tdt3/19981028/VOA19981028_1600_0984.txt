In about 21 hours U.S. Senator John Glenn returns to space. He'll 
enjoy a feast on his forthcoming trip on the Space Shuttle Discovery 
-- a feast compared with his first space flight some 36 years ago. 
During his 1962 orbit of the earth, Mr. Glenn's only food was a tube 
filled with applesauce. And he is reported to have found it was not 
very tasty. However, space food has come along way since Mr. Glenn's 
first historic flight. For his first voyage on Discovery, the 77-year-old 
Mr. Glenn, like the other astronauts, was allowed to choose his own 
menu. The Washington Post newspaper reports it includes shrimp cocktail, 
a beef dish for dinner, and scrambled eggs for breakfast.
