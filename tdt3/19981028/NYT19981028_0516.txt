When he was the underboss and No. 2 power in the Gambino crime family 
in the early 1990s, Salvatore Gravano decided that his bodyguard and 
chauffeur lacked a killer's instincts and was unfit to become a Mafia 
soldier. So, as a substitute promotion, Gravano said, he arranged 
for his driver, Louis Saccenti, to become a longshoremen's union official, 
according to a report Wednesday by the agency that regulates stevedore 
operations on the New York and New Jersey piers. The agency, the Waterfront 
Commission of New York Harbor, revoked Saccenti's right to work as 
a longshoreman and as a supervisor and urged his union, the International 
Longshoremen's Association, to remove him from his posts as a vice 
president of the union's Atlantic Coast District and as a delegate 
for Local 1 in Newark. The commission found that Saccenti, 57, lied 
under oath at an administrative hearing about his dealings with Gambino 
members and that from 1981 to 1996, he met regularly with 38 family 
members at Gambino hangouts in the city. Saccenti, the commission 
asserted, also siphoned $1,700 from a union welfare fund and put in 
false work claims on days that he was meeting with mobsters and was 
absent from his waterfront jobs. For 40 years, the ILA in the New 
York area and on the East Coast has been the target of federal and 
state investigations into penetration and corruption by organized 
crime. Asked about the current extent of Mafia rackets on the waterfront, 
Patrick Vetrano, the commission's chief counsel, said, ``It's not 
the overt stuff we had years ago, but they are constantly trying to 
get influence and their people into positions of power.'' Weighing 
heavily against Saccenti was a statement by Gravano to federal authorities 
in 1994 after he defected and became a government witness against 
John J. Gotti, the family boss, and other organized crime figures. 
In his statement, which was turned over to the commission by the U.S. 
attorney's office in Manhattan, Gravano, who was known in the Mafia 
as Sammy the Bull, identified Saccenti as an ``associate'' or worker 
for the Gambino family and as his ``driver and bodyguard'' from 1986 
to 1990. ``I intended at one time,'' Gravano said in his statement, 
``to make Saccenti a soldier but decided not to do so because Saccenti 
could not do a piece of work or murder, and that he would be killed 
if he failed to do so.'' Gravano was indicted with Gotti on federal 
murder and racketeering charges in 1990 but in 1991 pleaded guilty 
to reduced charges. For his role as a key witness against Gotti and 
other reputed mobsters, he was freed after five years in federl custody 
and after admitting that he had participated in 19 murders. Saccenti's 
lawyer, Gerald McMahon, said that his client no longer worked as a 
longshoreman and described the commission's action as meaningless 
and an attempt to get favorable press attention. McMahon denied that 
Saccenti had been a bodyguard for Gravano, maintaining that they had 
been neighbors in Staten Island and that Saccenti, a bricklayer, had 
worked for Gravano's construction company when he was laid off from 
waterfront jobs. ``If he was so close to Gravano and other Gambino 
members, why has he never been arrested or indicted for any crime,'' 
McMahon said of Saccenti. ``In 1988 and '89 he did associate with 
Gravano and so did a million other people.'' John Bowers, the ILA's 
president, who was in Philadelphia Wednesday on union business, said 
through a spokesman that he would have no comment until he had read 
the commission's report. The spokesman, James McNamara, said that 
Saccenti's salary as one of 16 vice presidents was about $70,000 a 
year but he was was uncertain what Saccenti was paid as a union delegate.
