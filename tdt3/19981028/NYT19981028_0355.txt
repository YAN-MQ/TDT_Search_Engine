That 800-pound gorilla beckoning to you to join him in the voting 
booth is The Impeachment Issue. I am alone in this view (though not 
in the anything-goes Clinton interpretation of ``alone''). The best 
political reporters assure us that the American voter cares not a 
whit about where candidates stand on what to do about a president 
who is _ no matter how you extenuate it _ an unconfessed serial perjurer. 
Even John Zogby, the only pollster who called the last election on 
the button, finds that by more than 2 to 1, respondents say impending 
impeachment will not be a factor in their vote. How, in the face of 
all this objective reporting, and aware of the personalities that 
affect each local election, can I cling to the iconoclastic belief 
that impeachment is the gut issue in the 1998 campaign? One reason 
is that normal, forthright people, not under oath, will happily mislead 
pollsters and journalists with the same equanimity that Clinton will 
half-truth grand jurors. Beyond that, even Zogby admits that ``the 
nasty secret of this business'' is that more than half the people 
approached by pollsters tell them to get lost. These silent majoritarians 
who assert their privacy are my kind of guys. Many are afflicted with 
``pluralistic ignorance'' _ that is, they do not realize that most 
other people feel the way they do _ and so refuse to tell strangers 
what they mistakenly think is a minority view, disapproved of by the 
elites. The other reason that impeachment stalks this campaign so 
stealthily is that Republican politicians _ fooled by folks who fancy 
focus-groupies _ have been afraid to take too stern a position about 
repeated lying under oath by a federal official sworn to uphold the 
law. The GOP has been spooked by its fear of ``energizing'' the wrong 
``core.'' As a result, throughout this campaign the Republican leaders 
have been playing not to lose. Such a cautious, run-out-the-clock 
game plan is unworthy of the contest. The way to win is to play to 
win. Speaker Gingrich and Senator Lott decided this summer that good 
ends (electing more Republicans) justified the worst means: they abandoned 
the tax cuts needed to avert recession, and blew off spending caps 
with phony emergencies to accommodate liberal handouts. These neo-Quiddist 
savants figured if they went along with the Clinton pandering to the 
teachers' lobby, and caved in to his doubletalk on ``saving the surplus,'' 
the boat would not rock; voter lethargy and media boredom would carry 
them to veto-proof majorities. Then they could fix what they helped 
foul up. But playing not to lose was a loser. The Gingrich-Lott ``pree-vent 
dee-fense'' led to legislating in the darkness to appease the liberals, 
and Clinton took them to the cleaners. Their Faustian budget deal 
broke faith with the voters who brung 'em and made GOP incumbents 
seem lazy incompetents. Their campaign strategy looked shyly away 
from Topic A. Now, in the final week, Gingrich and Lott realize that 
the focus is on infidelity, all right _ their infidelity to conservative 
principle. The consensus forecast has dropped to a GOP single-digit 
seat gain in the House, two or three in the Senate. That's because 
Republicans have failed to join the paramount issue in this campaign: 
In most cases, a Democratic vote this year helps protect Clinton no 
matter what new evidence an impeachment inquiry finds, thereby placing 
this and future presidents high above the rule of law. Contrariwise, 
a Republican vote builds strength in Congress to show that a pattern 
of deceit and other abuses not limited to ``lying about sex'' should 
have the most serious consequences. Even the claim to a sex exception 
from the oath is troubling: What about perjury to protect your child? 
Your lifelong business partner? A handicapped person? Where do exceptions 
end? Belatedly, ever so tastefully, GOP spots will touch on the scandal 
in the final days. We can at last see the impeachment issue raised 
in the slow-motion showing of the film clip that will dog Bill Clinton 
to the end of his days: looking us right in the eye and wagging his 
finger in our faces to make us listen to him lie in his teeth. Watch 
for it. Then Americans can ask one another the question: Is it right 
for this country to let any president, of either party, get away with 
that?
