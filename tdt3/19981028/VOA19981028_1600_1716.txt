Well, speaking of smoke and fire places, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 
there's been a change at H&J McNally's Tavern, and that is that they've 
banned smoking. It may be the first bar in Philadelphia to do so. 
Manager Anne McNally says her father has been urging her for years 
to go smokeless. She finally made the move when she became pregnant. 
Business is good at H&J McNally's, and bartender Matt McFlarey says 
the change is attracting more families. But not all the customers 
are happy. One of them, Jerry Donavon, says he misses a cigarette 
while he sips his beer. Mr. Donavon says if people want a smokeless 
environment, they should go to a health spa. I'm not so sure I agree 
with that. I think smokeless is the way to go.
