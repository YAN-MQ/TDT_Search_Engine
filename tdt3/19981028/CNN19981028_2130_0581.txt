Attorney general Janet Reno held a meeting at the justice department 
with abortion rights leaders to discuss recent violence against doctors 
and clinics that perform abortions. It came just days after a sniper 
killed a doctor who performed abortions in upstate New York. The president 
of planned parenthood says Reno was ready to establish a plan to protect 
providers. Sources tell CNN the FBI took suggestions from the representatives 
on how to deal with the violence.
