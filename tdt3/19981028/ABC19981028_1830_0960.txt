From Brazil today, an announcement that much of the world has been 
waiting for the. The Brazilian government is going to take financial 
reform very seriously. There will be a tax increase and budget cuts, 
which brings them one step closer to getting ab aid package. This 
is a plan that could help avoid a crisis in Latin America that might 
hurt America, namely, the USA more than the Asian crisis has. "On 
the money," here is ABC's Betsy Stark. Walk down the street in Rio 
De Janiero and you begin to understand why the United States is so 
determined not to let the Brazilian economy fail. Levi Strauss has 
250 retail stores here, more than in any other country. A new McDonald's 
opens every three days. General Motors sold 400,000 cars to brazilians 
last year. Walk into a store and brazilians are buying refrigerators 
made by Whirlpool and razor blades made by Gillette. "The makeup I 
wear is American," says this young woman. This young man uses American 
contact lens solution. His computer is an IBM. We're dealing here 
with the eighth or ninth largest economy in the world, a Country of 
175 million people. That is the critical factor in south America. 
450 of the fortune 500 companies have operations in Brazil. The American 
chamber of commerce says exports to Brazil support more than 200,000 
high-wage American jobs. That is why U.S. officials are so anxious 
to see President Cardoso's economic reform plan work, and why the 
United States may offer billions of dollars in aid to Brazil, beyond 
what it contributes through the international monetary fund. If Brazil 
does not get out of trouble, then millions of brazilians will have 
less money to buy what the U.S. sells there. And with Asian consumers 
already out of the mix, American businesses would surely feel the 
pinch. Betsy Stark, ABC News, New York.
