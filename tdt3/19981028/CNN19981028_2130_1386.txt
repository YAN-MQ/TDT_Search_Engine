Is that Johnson's team behind us? Exactly. Are they members of hertz 
#1 club gold? exactly. Are we members of hertz #1...? Not, not... 
not exactly. So thanks to hertz, they're going to get to the meeting 
on time. And we'll be late. So exactly what'll I tell the boss, hmm? 
In rent-A-car, there's hertz and there's "not exactly." Make sure

presentation. Is he buying it? Not exactly.
