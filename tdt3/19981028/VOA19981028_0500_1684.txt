In a suburb of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Vito Caposhus and wife will owe 
about $5,000 in property tax on their house. Now, that is a lot of 
money, but it could have been much worse. Local officials say that, 
because of a computer error, the first Caposhus property tax bill 
was for about $43,000. According to the mistaken tax assessment, their 
home was worth more than a million dollars. What a surprise when the 
tax bill showed that the couple had installed 250 new fireplaces in 
the house. In fact, they don't even have one fire place. Well, I tell 
you what. I mean, it's a wonder Mr. Caposhus didn't have a heart attack, 
you know and he's not since dead. I mean, can you imagine? Put yourself 
in that position, you know. The tax bill comes and you know what it 
is, and you think it's kind of an annoyance,... ... Mm-hmm. ... But 
you think you know how much it is. And then you open it up: $43,000. 
All that official stamp stuff on it from the state. I've heard of 
stories to where you get refunds from the Internal Revenue Service 
for, like, $110 million. Would you think they're going to let you 
cash that check? No, no. You've got a wrong check. If you get a wrong 
bill from the county or the state or whoever sends you a tax bill 
-- I've heard stories to where it's taken people years to straighten 
that out. Is that right? And they'll put a lien on your houses and 
take your houses away. "I want my $43,000; then we'll talk." Well. 
Oh, Mr. Caposhus! ... fire places. We hope we're not making jokes 
about a serious plight for you. We hope you've got yourself out of 
this predicament.
