For major TV networks, sports programming once was considered money 
in the bank. That may be changing. Greg LaMotte has a look. Pro football 
ratings down, the world series a ratings bust, a Former NHL champion 
files for bankruptcy. There's a player lockout in the NBA and the 
season could be lost. What is up with pro sports? Why are the ratings 
taking a dive? Are fans losing interest? If so, why? The fans are 
fed up with the high salaries. When is enough, enough? What's the 
difference between a $5 million contract and a $6 million contract? 
It's the same stupid thing. While big-time contracts may be eroding 
fan support, there is another fact to consider -- a bigger Pie. There's 
two ESPN channels. There's fox sports channels. There's tons of sports 
on TV. Eventually, it all cannibalizes each other, and that also plays 
a part in the decline in the ratings. Angry fans, more Pie -- anything 
else? I think, in part, a lot of sports fans are going to the Internet, 
they're going to other activities. Young sports fans or potential 
sports fans are going to video games or whatever. But also, I think 
a lot is lost to shortened attention span. People are sitting there 
maybe watching a little portion of the game, but they're flipping 
around to other things. They're not only changing channels, they're 
also changing where they watch. Many go to sports bars, for instance, 
others have their own satellite dishes. And the Internet is loaded 
with instant sports the nielson ratings miss. And given the glut of 
sports on television these days, one could argue there may be more 
sports fans than ever before. But there is something else to at least 
consider. The nation is getting older. Nowadays, maybe the games people 
are interested in aren't necessarily on a Playing field. Greg LaMotte, 
CNN, Los Angeles.
