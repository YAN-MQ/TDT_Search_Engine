The Clinton administration says the IBM Corporation in a project funded 
by the U.S. government has developed a new super computer capable 
of working twice as fast as any of its predecessors. VOA's David Gallast 
has details from the White House. Development of the new computer 
nickname "Pacific Blue" was announced here with great fanfare by Vice 
President Al Gore, who has been a spokesman for the administration 
on technological advances. Mr. Gore said the new machine far exceeds 
the capabilities of IBM super computer Deep Blue, which became famous 
for its competition with chess grand masters. The Vice President joked 
that Pacific Blue would make Deep Blue green with envy. It's more 
than twice as fast as any other computer in existence today. It's 
15,000 times faster than the average personal computer and has 80,000 
times the memory, which means it has enough memory to store every 
single book in the Library of Congress. Pacific Blue was built by 
IBM for the U.S. Department of Energy and is capable of making nearly 
four trillion calculations per second. That has long been held to 
be the threshold level for a computer fully capable of simulating 
nuclear weapons explosions. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said 
Pacific Blue will make it possible for the United States to be part 
of the global nuclear test ban. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treat signed 
by President Clinton in 1996 is the culmination of 40 years of effort 
to reach this key objective of nuclear arms control. These computers 
will help to ensure that we can maintain and enhance our security 
under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Along with its military applications, 
Mr. Gore said the new generation of computers will also be capable 
of making accurate forecasts of global climate change, one of his 
pet issues, and also opened the way to making the Internet 100 times 
faster than it is now within a few years. David Gallast, VOA News, 
the White House.
