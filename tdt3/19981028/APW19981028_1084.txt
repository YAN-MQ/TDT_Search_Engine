Guerrillas fired mortars and rockets at Israeli army and allied militia 
outposts in southern Lebanon Wednesday, wounding an Israeli soldier 
and five militiamen, security officials said. Iranian-backed Hezbollah 
guerrillas opened fire at an Israeli outpost at Blatt, some 3 kilometers 
(2 miles) north of the Israeli border Wednesday afternoon, wounding 
the soldier, the officials said. In Israel, an army spokesman said 
the soldier was seriously injured by mortar fire. Later, pro-Syrian 
Amal guerrillas attacked two outposts of the Israeli-backed South 
Lebanon Army militia near the village of Qantara, 10 kilometers (six 
miles) west of the Israeli border, officials said, speaking on customary 
condition of anonymity. Five militiamen were injured in that attack. 
The Shiite Muslim guerrillas of the Hezbollah and Amal militias have 
been fighting to dislodge some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied 
militiamen from the border strip in south Lebanon which Israel set 
up in 1985 to try to protect its northern settlements.
