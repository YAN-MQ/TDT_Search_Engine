In Yugoslavia, a prisoner helps his jailer escape. Convicts line up 
to wash brains under a tap in China. A Gypsy fortune teller in Romania 
is reading the palm of a man _ but he has a hook instead of a hand. 
Jokes with a bitter twist are on display in drawing form at the international 
black humor festival in Bucharest, home to some of the darkest laughs 
known to modern man. Cartoons from countries where freedoms are curbed 
-- China, Iran and Yugoslavia -- shine in this week-long fest. Cartoonists 
from the West pale in comparison, trying to be too clever or focusing 
on the frivolous. Black humor, say aficionados, combines intelligence, 
wit and a sense of cruelty. Its object is horror. ``It's a superior 
form of optimism. You go beyond (the horror),'' said theater director 
Alexandru Tocilescu visiting the exhibition of 250 drawings. Horia 
Patapievici, a Romanian philosopher and head of the nine-member jury 
which judged the 2,000 paintings and drawings submitted from 29 countries 
said: ``Either you identify with horror or, in black humor, you put 
a distance between you and it.'' Countries such as Iran, Ukraine and 
Russia have a closer relationship to tragedy which is why their jokes 
pack a punch. Western countries haven't known any real horror since 
the Nazi era, he said. Painted in somber tones, the winning cartoon 
created by Bulgarian artist Stefan Despodov depicts a man reading 
a newspaper being punched by a man in a photograph on the front page. 
``The cartoon represents the aggression in the press of the ordinary 
citizen,'' said Patapievici. ``In Bulgaria, like Romania, the language 
of journalists is violent and cruel,'' he said. In the first two days, 
some 6,000 people flocked to see exhibition and one of the four plays 
staged for the festival which aims to make light of the darker aspects 
of life. The exhibition opened Monday in Bucharest's Bulandra theater. 
The capital of a land that gave the world Dracula and vampires is 
a fitting venue for an exhibition on cruelty and humor. Under the 
late Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, there was even rumored 
to be a special department in the Securitate secret police responsible 
creating and spreading the dark humor jokes. Sponsored by a mobile 
phone company, the main theme of the exhibition is communication. 
While there are plenty of entries featuring mobile phones, the joke 
was also on the sponsor. Asked details about the exhibition, an employee 
at the theater where the exhibition is being held said: ``You'll have 
to speak to the sponsors. They don't talk to us much.''
