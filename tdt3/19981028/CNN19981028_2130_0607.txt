Tomorrow's launch of space shuttle discovery would be business as 
usual, if not for a certain 77-year-old American icon joining in for 
the ride. Mark Potter has more in this edition of "tech trends." For 
Don lisi, a payloads technician with the Boeing company, the day begins 
at 6:45 as he heads for work at the Kennedy space center. All right, 
how ya doing today? Good, and yourself? All right, have a good day 
now. Thanks, you too. After clearing security at the space station 
processing facility, he joins a group of technicians and engineers 
contracted by NASA, who use sophisticated scopes and computers to 
precisely measure equipment racks that will fly on the international 
space station. This system, I believe, goes down to a thousandth of 
an inch, between the three scopes. Lisi has been with the space program 
for nine years, and has worked on STS-95, the John Glenn shuttle mission. 
It kind of smacks you in the face and says, "boy, everything we do 
here is a little bit of history." I feel very privileged to get to 
do that. For the Glenn mission, he helped load some of the experiments, 
and worked on the Spartan satellite, which will be used to study the 
sun. He never got to meet John Glenn, a man he admires, but caught 
a fleeting glimpse of him one day at the elevator. And, of course 
he was swarmed by people, and I couldn't get close enough to shake 
his hand. It was pretty exciting to see basically a national treasure 
doing what he always wanted to do. As lisi's day progresses, the testing 
continues. This time of the rack insertion device, which will load 
the space station modules. One benefit of working here is that lisi 
and his colleagues have a front row seat for all the shuttle launches 
-- particularly nice if it's one they worked on. And liftoff. After 
it launches, you feel the Rumble and your skin crawls a little bit, 
and you're filled with excitement and patriotism. And knowing you 
had a little piece of it, quite a bit of excitement, something you 
never really get used to. It never gets old. And would he like to 
be on board the shuttle? I wouldn't hesitate for a minute. I would 
really love it. More of that famous NASA can-do spirit. Mark Potter, 
CNN, at the Kennedy space center.
