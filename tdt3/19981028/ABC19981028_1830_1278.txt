We are going to focus on the space program again tonight. 24 hours 
from now, if all goes well, the seven astronauts on board the shuttle 
"discovery," including John Glenn, will be safely in orbit. And most 
of us who watch the launch, which we'll cover live, will be getting 
on with other business. It was not always thus. 35 years ago, at the 
height of the cold war with the Soviets, the night before a launch 
was electric. The whole nation was engaged in the space race, though 
not all the memories are happy ones. Just ask the women. In 1960, 
jerrie cobb was one of those who had the right stuff. She and 12 other 
women were recruited by NASA to compete with the Russians. Most people 
didn't even know we existed, you know, that women had been -- had 
passed the same test that the Mercury astronauts had. In fact, they 
did better than that. Jerrie cobb and several other women did even 
better in training than some of the men. Did better in some cases, 
than John Glenn. If things had been fair, jerrie cobb who is now 67, 
and probably several other women, would have gone into space as Russian 
women did. But after months of training, NASA suddenly said that to 
be an astronaut, you had to be a military test pilot. There was a 
wrong time. They had to fly the boys first. Jerrie cobb is one of 
the most accomplished civilian pilots in the nation. But it didn't 
matter. The military was determined to shut the women out and NASA 
agreed. The women took their case to the public, but to no avail, 
listen to this reporters' 1960s question. A pretty girl like you, 
must think something about marriage. What about that? no. I'm not 
more interested in this right now than anything else in the world. 
With support from a senator's wife who was also a pilot, the women 
took their case to the Congress. John Glenn was called to testify. 
He said that men fly the planes, that's the social order in America. 
The "Mercury 13" women as they were called would be forever earthbound. 
A year later, in 1963, the Russians put the first woman into space. 
Valentina terishkova was a factory worker. Jerrie cobb will be there 
to wish John Glenn well tomorrow. For many of the other women, the 
memories are too bitter.
