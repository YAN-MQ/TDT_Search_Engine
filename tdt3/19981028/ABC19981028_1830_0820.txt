Hurricane in the far western Caribbean, hurricane Mitch is pushing 
ever so slowly and powerfully into the coast of central America. It 
is just barely moving now, just two miles an hour, lingering over 
honduras with all those winds, that rain and those floods. The storm 
center hasn't even hit land yet. At least 32 people have been killed, 
including an American who was sailing off cancun, Mexico.
