a u.s. delegation will go to North Korea next month to negotiate access 
to an underground construction site that Washington thinks might be 
used for nuclear development. A State Department spokesman says the 
delegation will be led by Charles Cartman, who was a special envoy 
to the Korean peace talks. Under a 1994 agreement, North Korea agreed 
to suspend its nuclear program in exchange for two new atomic power 
reactors.
