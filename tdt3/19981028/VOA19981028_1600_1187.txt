The International Volleyball Federation has approved several rules 
changes which will make the game faster and, hopefully, more exciting. 
The main change is that teams will score points at each rally instead 
of when the team has served. The system is already in place for tiebreaks. 
Matches will be played in the best-of-five sets still. But now 25 
points for the first sets will determine the winner, and 15 points 
for the fifth set. The minimum lead of two points will still be necessary 
to win any set. Now, the new scoring system will be used in the men's 
World League, the women's Grand Prix, the Junior and Youth World Championships, 
and the World Cup and 2000 Sydney Olympics. However, it will not be 
used in the World Championships that get under way in Japan in November. 
So, essentially, it takes place beginning in 1999.
