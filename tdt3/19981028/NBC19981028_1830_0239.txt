The good news for the shuttle crew is that one of the largest storms 
of recent years, hurricane Mitch, remains well west of here. But that's 
bad news for the small countries of central America and the yucatan 
peninsula of Mexico. It's a nightmare of wind and rain there tonight. 
NBC's Kerry Sanders. Hurricane Mitch, taking aim on Honduras and Belize 
in central america with winds gusting at 120 miles per hour. More 
than 100,000 tonight, homeless. The storm, dumping up to 25 inches 
of rain. Flash floods, widespread. Authorities report, more than one 
dozen people, dead. National hurricane center experts in Miami fear 
the hurricane, parked 30 miles off the Honduran coast, means nonstop 
rain. And that will trigger mudslides. To the north in cancun, Mexico, 
popular with American vacationers, the problem today -- most flights, 
canceled. Deborah and Charles Boyd, from New Jersey -- We're going 
to have to go back to the hotel and sit this storm out. For beachfront 
hotels built on solid foundations, as hurricane mitch looses power, 
that's good news. But for the people who work in these hotels, it's 
unlikely their homes could withstand even a tropical storm. In the 
Santa Cruz neighborhood -- most homes, built out of sticks. Miguel 
Chi hau and his family, watching TV today for updates on hurricane 
mitch. The hope tonight -- that hurricane Mitch will take another 
turn away from this coast where more than 500,000 people live. Kerry 
Sanders, NBC news, cancun, Mexico.
