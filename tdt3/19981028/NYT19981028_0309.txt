The machines, the weather and John Glenn himself were ``go'' for launching, 
as countdown preparations progressed smoothly toward the liftoff of 
the space shuttle Discovery, scheduled for 2 p.m. Thursday, on the 
most eagerly awaited space mission in years. All because of Glenn, 
returning to space after 36 years, crowds of well-wishers were already 
descending on the Kennedy Space Center here and were expected to swell 
into the hundreds of thousands. The expected turnout of 3,700 media 
people is thought to be the largest since the Apollo lunar flights. 
All the major television networks will show the liftoff live _ something 
else that has not happened in a long time. And President Clinton is 
expected to fly in to celebrate the comeback mission of the national 
hero who was the first American to orbit the planet. Glenn's three-orbit, 
five-hour flight in a tiny Mercury capsule occurred on Feb. 20, 1962, 
when Bill Clinton was still in high school. Glenn, the retiring Democratic 
senator from Ohio, will join six other astronauts on a planned nine-day 
mission devoted primarily to astronomical observations, tests of new 
space hardware, experiments in materials processing in weightlessness 
and biological and medical studies, including monitoring Glenn's health 
as an experiment in the physiology of aging. Thomas Holloway, NASA's 
shuttle program manager, reported Wednesday that all the preparations 
and tests on the Discovery were ``proceeding exceptionally well and 
all systems are go.'' The seven crew members were ``in the best of 
spirits and more than ready to go,'' said Col. Charles Precourt, chief 
of the astronaut office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, at 
a news conference at Cape Canaveral. They had a barbecue with their 
families on Tuesday night, paid a traditional visit to the launching 
pad Wednesday morning and spent the rest of the day in briefings and 
some late-afternoon flying. Precourt, an astronaut himself, said that 
Glenn was holding his own and fitting in well with the rest of the 
crew, most of whom are half his age. ``His attitude is infectious,'' 
Precourt said. ``He's very eager to get the work done.'' Meteorologists 
flashed a green light on the weather. Their forecast was for a 100 
percent chance of favorable weather at launching time: clear, dry 
and calm skies. It is rare for a weather forecast here to be so unambiguous 
and optimistic, and much better than Glenn had to contend with in 
1962. His launching then was postponed 10 times, 4 for bad weather. 
``It looks like Mother Nature wants John Glenn to return to space 
just like the rest of us,'' said Capt. Cliff Stargardt, an Air Force 
meteorologist. The expected presence of Clinton and scores of congressional 
leaders and celebrities has led to especially tight security precautions, 
including requirements for visitors to pass through a close inspection 
at three checkpoints. Describing the ``heightened security precautions,'' 
Robert B. Sieck, director of shuttle operations here, said, ``It's 
a common-sense thing to do, considering the environment today, the 
attention this is getting and what's going on in the world.'' After 
several years of pressing his case for a second chance to fly in space, 
Glenn was added to the Discovery crew in January. The decision was 
made by NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin after consulting with medical 
experts on the scientific merit of aging tests on Glenn and receiving 
assurances that Glenn was physically fit to fly. Physicians said he 
passed all the tests required of any non-pilot crew member. In a recent 
interview, Glenn conceded that his ``body flexibility is not as good 
as it used to be, and that becomes apparent every day.'' He noticed 
especially he tries to enter the shuttle hatch. ``I don't bend quite 
like the others in the crew do,'' he said. That is not expected to 
stop him when he suits up Thursday morning and climbs into the Discovery 
and takes his place below the flight deck. With him will be Lt. Col. 
Curtis Brown and Lt. Col. Steven Lindsey, the Air Force officers who 
are the commander and pilot, respectively. Others on the crew are 
Dr. Stephen Robinson, an engineer; Dr. Scott Parazynski, a physician; 
Pedro Duque, a Spanish aeronautical engineer representing the European 
Space Agency, and Dr. Chiaki Mukai, a physician and medical researcher 
from Japan.
