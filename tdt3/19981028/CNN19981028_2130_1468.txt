Archeologists in Egypt have fished out a piece of antiquity from Alexandria 
harbor. Divers winched a well-preserved sphinx from the harbor floor 
today. Archeologists had used global satellite positioning devices 
to map out an area of the harbor where several statues and other items 
have been found. Egyptian officials say they may turn the site into 
an underwater museum, complete with glass-walled viewing tunnels.
