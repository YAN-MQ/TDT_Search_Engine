A $10 million republican ad campaign is drawing a lot of fire from 
democrats. It features three ads that focus on President Clinton's 
denials about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Should we reward 
Bill Clinton? Should we make the democrats more powerful? The message 
republicans want to get across is "voters can't trust the president." 
That isn't sitting well with Mr. Clinton's supporters. Vice President 
Gore says he believes Americans are fed up with what he calls a republican 
obsession with attacking the president, and he says voters won't even 
consider the ads when they head to the polls. I think the American 
people will look at these ads and say, enough is enough. Get on with 
the business of the American people and talk about the real issues. 
Some republican officials have been quoted as saying the issue of 
the president's morality still bothers many Americans. They say the 
GOP must take that into consideration. The ads will run in 32 key 
congressional districts.
