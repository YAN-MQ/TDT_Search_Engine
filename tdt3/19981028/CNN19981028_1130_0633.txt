South Africa's truth and reconciliation commission says it will remove 
former President F.W. De Klerk's name from the final report. De Klerk 
had filed suit to block the report's release because he objected to 
the finding that he was an accessory after the fact to the bombings 
of a Church group and labor federation. Commission chairman says the 
name will appear in later editions, after a Court settles the issue.
