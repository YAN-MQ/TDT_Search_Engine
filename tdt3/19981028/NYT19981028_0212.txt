Picture a cartoon: a woman opens a door labeled ``computer room'' 
only to find shelves of loose-leaf binders and a surprised group of 
labcoat-wearing men shuffling papers. ``We're updating the database,'' 
the caption reads. That cartoon might come close to describing the 
task facing Bob Mankoff, cartoon editor for The New Yorker and head 
of the Cartoon Bank, the archive of 60,000 of the magazine's classic 
cartoons, and an additional 20,000 from other sources. Mankoff, who 
also is a cartoonist for the magazine, is turning the magazine's paper 
database into a digital one. On Nov. 30, coinciding with The New Yorker's 
annual cartoon issue, the magazine plans to redesign the Cartoon Bank 
Web site. The site, www.cartoonbank.com, will incorporate a searchable 
database of about 5,000 cartoons, all digitally watermarked to help 
prevent unauthorized use. Those interested in licensing any cartoon 
can search on the Web site by keyword or description, and select the 
cartoon. But they will have to place a phone call to complete the 
order. Mankoff has a long-time interest in technology. During an interview, 
he volunteered to count to 32 in binary on the fingers of one hand 
and he recently rediscovered a cartoon he did at age 7, rendered in 
his trademark stippled style, showing a rampaging robot with ``TILT'' 
lighted up on its chest. His interests in computers and cartooning 
made him an an early believer that a revolution was brewing in the 
cartoon reprint market. In 1991, he offered to set up an electronic 
system for New Yorker cartoons. ``I know it wasn't actually practical'' 
to build a digital database at that point, Mankoff said, ``but I was 
intrigued by it.'' At the time, the publication gave 100 percent of 
reprint fees to cartoonists, so it didn't have much incentive. He 
then founded the Cartoon Bank privately, and represented both New 
Yorker and other panel cartoonists for a 50 percent cut. With substantial 
effort, Mankoff built up the library over the years until 1997, when 
The New Yorker purchased the Cartoon Bank and then shortly thereafter 
offered him the position of cartoon editor. Mankoff said that many 
contributors to The New Yorker now made more in reprint rights than 
they did for the first appearance of their work. He cited Peter Steiner's 
classic of one canine at a computer saying to another, ``On the Internet, 
nobody knows you're a dog.'' Steiner has earned more than $30,000 
for reprints of that cartoon alone, according to Mankoff. Mankoff's 
goal is to take advantage of the editorial process of six decades 
that's spawned the enormous number of published cartoons. ``What's 
extraordinary about this is that these 60,000 cartoons have gone through 
this process of weeding out,'' Mankoff said. He continually works 
on improving his methods for production and distribution of the digital 
files, because he does not want to see the quality suffer for reasons 
of technology. ``People have said to me, `This cartoon isn't funny,' 
'' Mankoff noted, ``But they never said, `This cartoon is fuzzy.'
