This is a new 30-second commercial that the Republican National Committee 
began broadcasting this week to support the party's Congressional 
candidates. PRODUCER: Russo Marsh &AMP; Raper Inc. ON THE SCREEN: 
The advertisement opens with two women in their 30s, talking to each 
other in a living room. They are dressed casually. One woman sends 
off her children, a boy and a girl. The camera focuses on the other 
woman and then follows their dialogue. The advertisement concludes 
with six words on the screen: ``Republicans. The balanced leadership 
we need.'' THE SCRIPT: First woman: ``What did you tell your kids?'' 
Second woman: ``I didn't know what to say.'' First woman: ``It's wrong. 
For seven months, he lied to us.'' Second woman: ``But aren't there 
other things to do?'' First woman: ``And say it's OK to lie? Besides, 
the Republicans are doing them. They cut taxes, they helped balance 
the budget, and they're putting people on welfare back to work. And 
now they have a plan to save Social Security.'' Second woman: ``But 
the Democrats say __.'' First woman: ``The truth is, the Democrats 
gave us higher taxes and more government.'' Second woman: ``Now there's 
a difference that really matters.'' First woman: ``Republicans are 
the balance we need.'' ACCURACY: President Clinton has acknowledged 
that his public comments about Monica Lewinsky ``gave a false impression'' 
of their relationship, and he has conceded that he ``misled people, 
including even my wife.'' Republican leaders of Congress did negotiate 
a tax cut with Clinton last year. They did help balance the budget 
by cutting many types of domestic spending. And Republicans led a 
two-year effort to redesign the nation's main welfare program by establishing 
stringent work requirements for people who receive cash assistance. 
But it is difficult to know exactly what the commercial means when 
it says that Republicans now ``have a plan to save Social Security.'' 
They have a multitude of proposals, but not ``a plan.'' In the last 
year, many Republicans have expressed interest in various proposals 
to revamp Social Security to keep it solvent for the baby boom generation. 
Neither the Republican Party nor its congressional leaders nor its 
rank and file has formally or officially endorsed a single plan to 
solve Social Security's long-range financial problems. Most Republicans 
who have studied the issue support some type of private retirement 
accounts that would allow workers to invest at least part of their 
payroll taxes in stocks or bonds. Republicans insist that this is 
still a worthy idea because such accounts would, on the average, pay 
a higher return than the government program. But the plunge in stock 
prices this summer illustrated the volatility of the market, and Republicans 
may not want to emphasize the details of their proposals at the moment. 
SCORECARD: This commercial pointedly reminds voters of the White House 
sex scandal. Indeed, that is its major objective, even though the 
commercial quickly moves to other issues that distinguish Republicans 
from Democrats. The opening line _ ``What did you tell your kids?'' 
_ is arresting. Most listeners will immediately recognize the subject 
even though Ms. Lewinsky's name is not mentioned. The commercial does 
not dwell on the scandal, a subject for which many citizens have expressed 
distaste. Thus, the commercial seeks to exploit the sex scandal without 
offending or disgusting voters. The commercial strongly suggests that 
it would be a mistake for voters to ignore the scandal, because to 
disregard it would be to condone lying. In referring to Republicans 
as ``the balance we need,'' the commercial plays up the idea that 
a Republican-controlled Congress is needed as a counterweight to a 
Democratic president. Some political scientists say that voters intuitively 
favor such a balance between the branches of government, even if voters 
do not consciously or explicitly recognize it as a reason for the 
choices they make on Election Day. The advertisement woos voters who 
may be tempted to accept Clinton's contention that his affair with 
Ms. Lewinsky does not matter much in next week's elections. Thus, 
it says, the parties' disagreement on taxes and the role of government 
is the difference that ``really matters.''
