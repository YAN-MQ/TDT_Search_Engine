Now, former Italian football league star, goalkeeper Walter Zanga, 
has been named player/coach of major league soccer's New England Revolution. 
The thirty-eight year-old Zanga said today that New England has become 
his home away from home, and he believes the team can be built into 
a championship contender. Zanga led the team to a 3-and-3 record this 
past season, after being named interim coach on August 24. In 1997, 
his play in the net boosted the team to its only MLS playoff berth.
