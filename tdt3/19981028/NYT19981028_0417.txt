A parade of prominent Democrats on Wednesday pounced gleefully on 
what they called a Republican blunder in waging a last-minute, multimillion-dollar 
advertising offensive that exploits President Clinton's sex scandal. 
``This is the kind of desperation that we can expect from Republicans 
as we get close to Election Day,'' said Vice President Al Gore. ``Attacking 
the president and investigating the president has apparently become 
an obsession with the Republicans.'' Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, general 
chairman of the Democratic Party, said: ``This is a desperate attempt 
from a Republican Party completely devoid of an agenda. The American 
people will see right through it and this cynical Republican ploy 
will backfire.'' Even Clinton joined in the assault, declaring that 
while Republicans were free to say whatever they wanted in their commercials, 
``it's fair for a person to be judged on his whole record.'' By late 
Wednesday, the Democratic Party had hastily begun assembling a commercial 
of its own in response to the Republicans' advertisements. In the 
commercial, a narrator says: ``This no ordinary time. Republicans 
have made removing the president from office their top priority. They 
want to waste millions of our tax dollars on endless investigations. 
Democrats believe this is about solving our real problems _ protecting 
Social Security, patients' rights, smaller class sizes, more teachers.'' 
The narrator closes: ``Next Tuesday, vote Democratic. And tell Congress 
we're ready to move on.'' While some Republican consultants agreed 
with Democrats that the advertisements were a mistake, or at least 
risky, officials of the National Republican Congressional Committee 
dismissed the notion that their commercials would spur any backlash. 
They said they were convinced that the advertisements would energize 
loyal Republican voters _ as well as people who were undecided but 
leaning toward Republican candidates. House Speaker Newt Gingrich 
personally approved the campaign, a top party official said. ``If 
the Democrats really believed that our message was the wrong message 
for us and that it was not going to work,'' said Mary Crawford, communications 
director of the congressional committee, ``why would they be squealing 
like stuck pigs?'' Republican Party officials said three scandal-related 
commercials were being broadcast in about 30 congressional districts. 
Of the three, the toughest is appearing in Southern and rural areas 
where the president is particularly unpopular. The others are being 
broadcast in more suburban and coastal districts where party polls 
found that people were still fuming over Clinton's misleading the 
public about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. The commercials, they 
said, were part of a $10 million advertising barrage in the final 
week of the campaign that includes spots on specific issues tailored 
to individual congressional districts; party officials would not say 
what proportion of the $10 million were for the scandal-related advertisements. 
The decision to emphasize the scandal marked an abrupt shift of strategy 
for the Republicans, who for weeks have stayed clear of the Lewinsky 
matter and advised many of the party's candidates not to raise the 
affair in their own advertisements. Party officials said that they 
had been moving toward the change of approach in recent days, and 
that a final decision was made on Monday. Gingrich, who has publicly 
counseled House members not to politicize the scandal, signed off 
on the decision, party officials said. ``He knew in general'' about 
the plans, said a top party official, speaking on the condition of 
anonymity. ``As we got more specific, he knew that as well.'' The 
advertising blitz stirred intense debate among Republicans, with some 
expressing fears that it could alter the dynamic _ to the detriment 
of Republicans _ in the closing days of the campaign. ``We took their 
bait _ this is exactly what the Democrats wanted,'' said Tom Edmonds, 
a Republican media consultant. ``It makes Republicans look unnecessarily 
mean spirited. They look like opportunists. There was absolutely no 
need to do this. This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. It's 
a self-inflicted wound.'' Even the chairman of the committee that 
sponsored the advertisements, Rep. John Linder of Georgia, the head 
of the National Republican Campaign Committee, said commercials focusing 
on the scandal could be perilous. ``If our candidates all pick up 
the cudgel to beat up on the president,'' he told reporters at a lunch 
on Tuesday, hours before the first advertisements were broadcast, 
``it could be overkill. And it could backfire.'' Tony Marsh, a Republican 
consultant who created one of the advertisements, said: ``Obviously, 
there's risk associated with everything. But it's an important message.'' 
While the commercials unmistakably bring up the scandal, they are 
careful not to appear too brazen. Marsh's commercial opens with one 
woman saying to another, ``What did you tell your kids?'' But after 
that suggestive beginning, the conversation turns to subjects of infrequent 
juvenile fascination _ big government and Social Security, The two 
other advertisements were produced by Michael Murphy, a veteran media 
consultant. In one, the narrator asks, ``Should we reward not telling 
the truth?'' The other does not cite the scandal in the text, but 
ends with the perhaps more powerful image of Clinton wagging his finger 
at the camera when he denied his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. Rep. Dick 
Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the House, said that 
in its advertisement responding to the attacks, the Democrats could 
not afford to match spending of the Republicans. He said the spot 
would make the point that ``if you want to spend another two years 
investigating the president's sex life, vote for Republicans.''
