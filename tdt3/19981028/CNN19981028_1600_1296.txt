Say good-bye to two more weeks. I'm Anthony Keith James, and this 
is "CNN Headline Sports." The NBA is zero for October and the same 
holds for November. The league, today, canceling two more weeks of 
games, wiping out the entire month of November. The earliest the games 
can now begin is December 1st. So far, the lockout has wiped out 194 
regular season games.
