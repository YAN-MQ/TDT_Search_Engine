Colombian president Andres Pastrana got a warm welcome this morning 
when he arrived at the White House for a state visit. Relations between 
the U.S. and Colombia are much better with pastrana than with his 
predecessor, who was suspected of supporting narcotics traffickers. 
Pastrana is looking for international help for Colombia's economy. 
But U.S. officials want assurances Colombia remains committed to fighting 
drug dealers.
