to Tipay by its own captain. VOA's Roger Wilkison has this report. 
from Beijing. An official at Beijing Airport has confirmed the hijacking 
of Air China Flight 905. He says the plane has landed at an airport 
outside Tipay. The official says 20 of the 95 passengers aboard the 
aircraft are foreigners. The plane also carried nine crew members. 
The Taiwanese government television station reports China has demanded 
the immediate return of the airliner and the hijacker. The station 
is quoting a control tower official in Taiwan as saying the aircraft's 
pilot hijacked the plane. China and Taiwan have an informal pact under 
which Chinese air pilots can be repatriated, but the hijackers usually 
have to serve out their sentences in Taiwan first. Roger Wilkison,
