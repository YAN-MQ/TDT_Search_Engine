Delivering a blunt reminder to investors that the World Wide Web can 
be treacherous, federal regulators said Wednesday that they had accused 
44 stock promoters of fraudulently promoting more than 235 small companies 
on the Internet. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which created 
a special enforcement squad to police Internet frauds, called the 
civil enforcement action the first such nationwide crackdown. The 
SEC accused an array of little-known stock promoters in 10 states 
and the District of Columbia of ``illegally touting securities'' and 
misleading investors about their relationships with the companies 
they were promoting. Often, regulators said, the promoters recommended 
stocks but failed to disclose that they were being paid in cash or 
stock by the companies they were promoting. Often, the agency said, 
the promoters sold their own shares as the price of a stock jumped 
in the period after they pumped up its virtues. ``In all of these 
cases, the Internet promoters gave ostensibly independent opinions 
about microcap companies that in reality were bought and paid for,'' 
Richard H. Walker, director of enforcement at the SEC, said in a statement. 
``Not only did they lie about their own independence, some of them 
lied about the companies they featured and then took advantage of 
any quick spike in price to sell their shares for a fast and easy 
profit.'' The promoters _ who wrote for online newsletters, posted 
messages on Web sites and flooded the Internet with junk e-mail _ 
were paid more than $6.2 million in cash by the companies whose shares 
they were promoting and were given 1.8 million shares of stock or 
stock options for their work, regulators said. The SEC said many of 
the accused had already agreed to settle the complaint by paying fines. 
Despite efforts by the SEC to combat Internet fraud, however, the 
scams have become increasingly sophisticated and varied. ``All types 
of scams are finding their way to the Internet,'' said John R. Stark, 
chief of the office of Internet enforcement at the SEC. ``You have 
Ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes, public offerings, oil and gas fraud, 
every kind of fraud.'' Much of the fraud, investigators say, involves 
small-time stock promoters, many of whom work out of their homes, 
and a host of tiny companies hoping to bolster the value of their 
penny stocks. But the range of schemes appears to have grown enormously, 
despite repeated warning from regulators that investors must be skeptical 
about what they find on the Internet. Stark says it is difficult to 
know who is falling for the misleading stock promotions. ``The profile 
is really all over the map,'' he said. ``Some people are sophisticated, 
some are not. There is no typical Internet victim. The fact is no 
one should be making investment decisions based on what they read 
over the Internet.'' That small companies in several of these cases 
paid as much as $300,000 to stock promoters on the Web is an indication 
of just how powerful a trading and investment tool the Internet has 
become in recent years and how seductive a vehicle of fraud it can 
become. In one case, an Internet newsletter called The Future Superstock 
recommended that its more than 100,000 subscribers buy shares in about 
25 fast-growing companies whose share prices were expected to double 
or triple in the following months. The writer of the newsletter, which 
offers company profiles and ``hot breaking news,'' told subscribers 
that he had conducted independent research on the companies and that 
his stock-picking record was excellent. But what the writer, Jeffrey 
C. Bruss of West Chicago, Ill., did not fully disclose, according 
to federal regulators, was that the companies he was touting had paid 
him more than $1.6 million to do so. In fact, he had done little or 
no research, investigators say, and he misled subscribers about his 
stock picking record. Efforts to reach Bruss by telephone and e-mail 
were unsuccessful. In another case, Francis A. Tribble and his company, 
Sloane Fitzgerald, were accused of sending more than 6 million e-mails 
to fraudulently promote two small companies, including JT's Restaurants 
in New York. The SEC said many of the e-mails did not sufficiently 
disclose Tribble's compensation arrangements with JT's Restaurants, 
which is owned by his father, Joseph Tribble. Most of the e-mail suggested 
that it was from independent stock promoters named ``HotStock,'' ``Net-Vest'' 
and ``Cyber-Stock,'' according to the SEC. Francis Tribble and Sloane 
Fitzgerald agreed to pay a $15,000 civil penalty, the agency said. 
Although it is not illegal for a company to pay stock promoters to 
tout their stock, the promoters are required by federal law to disclose 
whether they are being paid by a company they are promoting, what 
form of payment they are receiving and how much they receive. With 
the huge proliferation of Web sites and bulletin boards, and the increasingly 
sophisticated methods use to engage in securities fraud, many say 
there are not enough regulators to begin to patrol the Internet. But 
regulators also point out that the Internet has become a tremendous 
tool for those willing to do research on investment opportunities 
and stock promoters. Already, there are sites devoted to combating 
stock scams, and the North American Securities Administrators Association, 
a group of state regulators, says it would like to form a neighborhood 
``watch'' program in which Internet users could funnel information 
about potential stock scams to a Web site. ``We have to do what we 
can,'' said Marc Beauchamp, a spokesman for the association, ``to 
make sure this medium is not overrun by charlatans.''
