Money in sports again. The national basketball association has canceled 
another two weeks of the season. That's on top of two weeks called 
off already because of the ongoing labor struggle between the players 
and the owners. So no basketball until at least December. If the lockout 
continues, the whole season is in jeopardy, which means it isn't just 
multimillionaire players and owners who are losing our, here's aBC's 
John Frankel. Like the long arms of so many NBA players, the league's 
prosperity reaches far and wide, making lots of money for other businesses. 
So no games means hard times for others. Including the taxpayers. 
This is reunion Arena, home of the Dallas Mavericks. Our facility 
specifically would lose millions, proximately 40% of our operating 
revenue would be gone. The Mavericks republican the this Arena. As 
with half of the buildings used by NBA teams, it is publicly owned. 
The city that stands behind the Arena will continue to have to pay 
the debt on the bonds. So some of the city budgets will end up being 
hurt by this. In Philadelphia, the NBA has secured 90% of all hotel 
space downtown for its all-star weekend in February. Canceling that 
game could cost the city $30 million. This hotel business, there will 
be hard to replace. Economically, to us, it's been $750,000 and $800,000. 
No games will even step on the toes of ever-present Nike, which has 
more than a $100 million tied up in NBA promotions. Some of those 
products, those shoes -- the only exposure they'll get will be on 
the feet of those players so, clearly, that will be missed. William 
Torres and his staff here at the sporting club in New York City, count 
on pro basketball. NBA games bring in the crowds and carry the bar 
through the winter. Without basketball, if we get maybe five or six 
tables, it will be considered a good night. Clearly this lockout will 
Rob the fortunes of more than just the owners and players. Someone's 
gonna have to hit them over the head and make them come to their senses 
and realize it's not just all about them. John Frankel, ABC News, 
New York.
