NBA owners met face to face with players today, but the only result 
was the cancellation of more games. From Chicago, George Offman reports. 
The league canceled the rest of the November schedule, bringing the 
total number of games lost to 194. League commissioner David Stern 
met with the Board of Governors. Then joined a few owners in meeting 
with 85 players. The discussion was termed heated at times, but also 
informative. Union leader Billy Hunter is optimistic a deal can be 
done and the season salvaged but added, the players aren't going to 
give in. The urgency is not one in which we are willing to say we're 
going to throw the hat in and we're going to accept what anybody puts 
on the table. We're just saying that, you know, time is of the essence. 
And the longer you wait, the chances of putting a deal together move 
further and further away. Maybe, we may not get the next opportunity 
until Christmas. The schedule has now been whittled down to a 68 game 
season, with the players having lost a collective 200 million-dollars 
in. For NPR News, I'm George Offman in Chicago.
