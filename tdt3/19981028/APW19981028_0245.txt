A Kosovo Albanian charged with sneaking hundreds of refugees into 
Germany went on trial Wednesday in another sign of German determination 
to crack down on smugglers and slow a growing tide of illegal immigration. 
The trial of the 28-year-old suspect, who was not identified, opened 
in Goerlitz, on the German-Polish border, amid tight security. Court 
officials said he had threatened to kill every police officer and 
prosecutor involved in the case if he is convicted. The man, who was 
not identified, was charged with smuggling 360 foreigners _ mainly 
fellow ethnic Albanians from Yugoslavia's Kosovo province _ into Germany 
in 12 transports early in 1994. The preferred route went from the 
Czech Republic to Poland and then into Germany at the Bad Muskau border 
crossing. He operated his smuggling operation for four years from 
the Czech Republic until being arrested last year in Prague and extradited 
to Germany, the Bild newspaper reported. Since the fall of the Iron 
Curtain, Germany has become a magnet for refugees from the east, who 
often travel thousands of kilometers (miles) in search of a better 
life. Despite a tightening of asylum laws and stepped up border patrols, 
the flood continues and has even increased in recent months due to 
the recent violence in Kosovo. German officials reported last week 
they had snared 35,205 foreigners seeking to enter the country illegally 
last year _ 30 percent more than 1996 _ and that statistics for 1998 
so far were running almost 14 percent higher than last year. Most 
_ 23,089 _ were caught on Germany's eastern border with Poland and 
the Czech Republic. Of those caught last year, 8,288 were smuggled 
into Germany by criminal gangs, compared with 7,364 in 1996. Just 
Tuesday, 59 Afghans were caught crossing the Czech border into Germany, 
about 30 kilometers (20 miles) south of Dresden, customs officials 
said. The refugees, including children, were hidden on a truck loaded 
with sheet metal. Also Tuesday, a Pakistani man, Azhar Mahmordizz, 
went on trial in another border town, Frankfurt an der Oder, on people 
smuggling charges. The 33-year-old is accused of masterminding a ring 
that smuggled 263 people foreigners into Germany in 23 separate groups 
from 1994 to 1996. The people _ from Pakistan, India, Somalia, Sri 
Lanka, Jamaica, Afghanistan, Turkey, Lebanon and Bangladesh _ paid 
dlrs 600 each and traveled via Uzbekistan, Belarus, Russia, Lithuania 
and Poland, often suffering cramped living and transport quarters 
on the way, prosecutors said.
