Two people were freed and seven people arrested during the first hours 
of a crackdown on hostage-takers in the breakaway region of Chechnya, 
a news agency said Wednesday. The offensive by Chechen law enforcement 
officials began Tuesday when they beefed up police checkpoints around 
the region and threatened harsher punishment for hostage-takers. Relatives 
of the hostages are also helping to look for the kidnappers. The two 
released hostages had been held for more than six months and a large 
ransom had been demanded, Chechen Security Minister Aslanbek Arsayev 
told Interfax. The seven people arrested were involved in their kidnapping, 
he said. He gave no details about the hostages. Chechen Deputy Prime 
Minister Kazbek Makhashev said authorities were willing to assign 
1,000 men to the anti-kidnapping effort, the ITAR-Tass news agency 
reported. Kidnappings and other crimes have become common in Chechnya 
since the end of its 1994-96 war with Russia. Chechen officials say 
103 people are still being held, including three Britons, a New Zealander 
and a Turk. Separate car bomb attacks this week killed Chechnya's 
top anti-kidnapping official and slightly injured a Muslim cleric. 
The violence has sometimes spilled over into neighboring regions and 
one of them, Dagestan, said Wednesday it had put border police on 
alert, fearing reprisals because of the hostage crackdown. Russia's 
Interior Ministry said Thursday it has massed 10,000 combat-ready 
troops on the border of Chechnya in Dagestan and the Stavropol region 
to ``ensure maintenance of public order'' and prevent any spillover 
violence. And Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov invited Chechen 
President Aslan Maskhadov to meet Thursday in an unspecified north 
Caucasus Mountains region, Maskhadov press secretary Mairbek Vachagayev 
said Wednesday, according to Interfax. Maskhadov has not decided whether 
to accept the invitation, Vachagayev said. Chechnya has been running 
its own affairs since the end of the war, but no country has recognized 
its independence claim. Moscow insists the territory remains part 
of Russia.
