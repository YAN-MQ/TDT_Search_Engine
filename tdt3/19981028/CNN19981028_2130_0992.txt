Starting Monday, Americans will be able to buy U.S. savings bonds 
a new way, under the government's "easy-saver plan." The treasury 
will deduct the costs of purchasing bonds directly from customers' 
bank accounts. They will be able to choose the dates they want the 
treasury to charge their accounts. The government hopes the new program 
will increase sales of U.S. savings bonds.
