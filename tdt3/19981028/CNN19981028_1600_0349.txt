More than 400 historians warn that the house impeachment inquiry could 
permanently damage the presidency. The house voted 258-176 for an 
open-ended investigation of president clinton. The historians say 
they do not condone Mr. Clinton's private behavior with monica Lewinsky, 
or his attempts to deceive. But they say the charges against Mr. Clinton 
depart from what the framers of the constitution intended as grounds 
for impeachment. All the charges so far brought forward by Kenneth 
Starr derive from a case of a person lying about his sex life. I do 
not think the founding fathers saw lying about your sex life, even 
lying under oath, as doing great injury to the state. I do not believe 
that they would feel that these would rise to impeachable offenses. 
The house impeachment investigation is expected to begin after next 
week's election.
