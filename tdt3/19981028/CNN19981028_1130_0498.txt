Coming up -- a check of the extended weather forecast for the United 
States. I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "Headline News weather." 
We're watching hurricane Mitch, of course. That should be moving through 
the Caribbean, possibly making landfall somewhere in Mexico, or perhaps 
Belize over the next 24 hours. Watching, too, a storm system which 
is moving through the upper midwest that will bring some heavier rain 
in through that area. And snow is expected to fly through the Rockies. 
Could see some strong to severe thunderstorms develop in parts of 
the plains overnight tonight and on into tomorrow. A look at temperature 
highs today, still warm along the gulf coast, into the 80s, ranging 
to the 40s back through the Rockies. Take a look now at the extended 
forecast, some snow in the Rockies during the day on Friday. Could 
see the first snows around Denver of the year. We'll find showers 
and storms in the southwest, and windy conditions in the northeast. 
The colder air spreading eastward into the upper midwest, much of 
the plains on Saturday. We'll find the wet weather and showers will 
continue in the pacific northwest. On into Sunday, it's even turning 
cooler in the southeast as highs return to the 40s, that's it, through 
much of the upper midwest. For more weather information, including 
a look at four-day forecasts for more than 7,200 cities, log into
