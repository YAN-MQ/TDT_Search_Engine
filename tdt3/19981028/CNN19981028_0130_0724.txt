Geologists have found evidence of the world's oldest known reptile 
nests in arizona's petrified forest national park. The nests date 
back 220 million years to the triassic period. Geologists say their 
existence shows protective parenting habits developed much earlier 
than previously thought. They say the evolution of the nest shows 
how some animals stopped laying their eggs directly on the ground 
and made a nest to protect their young.
