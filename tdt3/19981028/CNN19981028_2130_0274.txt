With less than a week of campaigning remaining before congressional 
elections, the republican party is pouring nearly $10 million into 
advertising in 56 congressional races. The thrust of the ads is to 
make President Clinton the issue in the election. Three ads targeted 
at races in 22 of the congressional districts mention, at least indirectly, 
the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The republicans are doing them. They 
cut taxes. They helped balance the budget. Democrats say the ads go 
too far in attacking Mr. Clinton, and they promise to respond. We 
will have a response ad, we'll have it tomorrow. We're going to run 
it in as many districts as we can where it makes sense to run it. 
We will simply be saying to people, if you want two more years of 
this endless investigation, vote republican. If you want your agenda 
dealt with, vote for democrats for the Congress. The whining you're 
seeing is because they're scared to death it's going to be effective. 
We had a very quiet one or two-hour meeting with our senior staff 
at the campaign committee and some consultants, and we concluded that 
we couldn't pretend that Clinton didn't exist. He is after all the 
personification of all that we're running against. And after a lot 
of conversation, we concluded that let's ask some professionals to 
bring us some story lines, some proposals, we looked over a lot and 
we selected these. The ad campaign represents a strategy shift for 
the republicans. They've been reluctant to bring up the Lewinsky issue 
for fear of a voter backlash.
