Hurricane Mitch may be weaker, but it still poses a dangerous threat 
to the western Caribbean. The storm has washed out roads and bridges, 
flooded neighborhoods, and killed at least 32 people. Mitch has dumped 
up to 25 inches of rain in mountain areas and tens of thousands of 
people in low-lying areas are fleeing their homes. At last report, 
the center of the storm was 25 miles north of Honduras, with maximum 
sustained winds of 105 miles an hour.
