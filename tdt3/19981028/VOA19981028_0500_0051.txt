I'm Miamani Crosby, VOA News. NATO ambassadors have warned Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevich that he still faces possible air strikes, 
even though NATO lifted its threat of immediate military action in 
the Kosovo crisis. The ambassadors say the alliance remains ready 
and willing to use force if President Milosevich sends new troops 
to Kosovo. President Clinton says he is encouraged by the troop withdrawal, 
but cautioned it remains a long, hard road to walk before there is 
full peace in the Balkans. I'm very encouraged that NATO's persistence 
and resolve have compelled President Milosevich to pull back his forces 
and comply very substantially with the demands of the international 
community. Mr. Clinton also said he hopes the troop pullbacks will 
prompt remaining refugees in Kosovo to return to their homes and seek 
relief help.
