On Wall Street, the bleak news about consumer confidence helped push 
stocks into Negative territory. The Dow Jones industrial average finished 
Tuesday's session at 8366, a 66-point drop. That drop in consumer 
confidence means Americans are growing more concerned about the economy 
and their jobs. Ceci Rodgers reports. At the crate and barrel on Chicago's 
magnificent mile, shoppers are still upbeat. My husband is working. 
I'm working. So we feel pretty comfortable right now. Plus, I'm a 
very good shopper. I go for the deals. The national retail federation 
is boldly predicting a 5% to 6% increase in holiday sales this year. 
But after October's nine-point drop in consumer confidence -- the 
fourth straight decline -- the conference board warns spending may 
slow. Private retail surveys are showing the first signs. The slide 
in consumer confidence that we've seen this year is as big as the 
drop we saw before the 1990 recession. And it's bigger than the drop 
that we saw before the slowdown in 1995/1996. So, I think consumers 
are worried about their jobs. The conference board said more people 
reported trouble finding jobs. And, in fact, the economy is adding 
jobs at half the pace of last year. But some analysts say consumers 
may begin to feel more confident as the effects of the federal reserve's 
rate cuts filter through the economy. A lot of businesses we speak 
to that were shellshocked about four weeks ago are looking for a better 
fourth quarter and a little bit more optimistic toward 1999. So we 
think consumer confidence will continue to build after this blip down. 
That's what the fed is banking on. The fed has cut rates twice to 
try to encourage businesses and consumers to spend to keep the economy 
going. And as signs of slowing growth mount, another rate cut is expected 
in november. Ceci Rodgers, "CNN Financial News," Chicago.
