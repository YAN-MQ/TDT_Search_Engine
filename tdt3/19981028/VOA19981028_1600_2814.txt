Astronauts on-board the U.S. Space Shuttle are planning a couple of 
unusual plant experiments, both designed by scientists at the University 
of Wisconsin at Madison. One study aims to see whether plants can 
be genetically engineered more efficiently in the weightless environment 
of space than is possible in earth-bound laboratories. A gene for 
a compound known to strengthen the human immune system will be inserted 
into specially prepared soybeans seedlings. When the seedlings return 
to earth, researchers will grow them and see how possess the new trait. 
Another plant experiment aboard the Shuttle looks at whether weightlessness 
changes the way plants produce their fragrant or flavorable essential 
oils -- complex chemicals that form inside the plant. Scientists know 
that even slight changes in a plant's environment can change the flavor 
or aroma of its oils. They believe a spin through weightless space 
would have a profound effect. For the flavors and fragrance industry, 
always scouting exotic locales for plants with interesting new tastes 
and smells, outer space might be the most exotic locale yet.
