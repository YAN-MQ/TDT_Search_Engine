NBC news "in depth" tonight -- the woman behind the man -- annie Glenn. 
She and her famous husband were childhood sweethearts. Now, after 
a life together filled with some remarkable highs, annie Glenn is 
ready to watch her man make one more run for the history books. We 
begin tonight's "in depth" reporting with the "today" show's Matt 
Lauer. It's a lifelong love affair that has spanned five decades. 
They met as children, playing in the same playpen, and before long, 
Glenn was hooked. When he appeared as an unknown pilot on the television 
quiz show, "name that tune," in 1957, he told the world about his 
childhood sweetheart. When I was 10, I liked a little girl in our 
class. The only trouble was, the other fellas in our class liked her, 
too. Did you finally get her to notice you? Yeah, I finally got her 
to marry me, in fact. When John Glenn married annie in 1943, he promised 
a lifetime filled with excitement. Whether it was that first trip 
to orbit or the 24 years Glenn spent as a United States senator, annie 
has been by his side, always supporting him. But John was always there 
for annie, as well. She spent years tirelessly working to overcome 
her severe stuttering. I was a 95% stutterer. It didn't make any difference 
to him. He's helped me all my life. And when John Glenn announced 
last year that he would not seek a Fifth term in the United States 
Senate, that was just fine with annie. I told everybody, I have given 
him to our country for 55 years, and I was ready to take him back, 
as mine. Then, Lo and behold, he announced he was going to go on this 
STS-95 flight, and he was just like a little kid. How do you think 
you'll be feeling when the rest of the world, and country, certainly, 
when all of us are hearing, "'T' minus ten, 'T' minus nine"? Well, 
that's another thing. I will probably have tears and I will probably 
cry. But that's all right. I'll be with our kids, and we will hug 
a lot, and I will pray a lot. And I'll be excited, too.
