A delegation of the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday evaluated 
Moldova's economic progress and discussed releasing a delayed dlrs 
28 million loan. ``This is a visit of evaluation and the government 
expects the IMF to draw some favorable conclusions regarding Moldova's 
reforms,'' said Valeriu Lazar, an adviser in the Economy Ministry. 
During the two-week visit, the IMF delegation led by Richard Haas 
will analyze Moldova's efforts to reduce its budget deficit, speed 
up privatization and provide social welfare for retirees. IMF officials 
will meet with officials from the central bank, the government and 
parliament and will visit several Moldovan companies. The Moldovan 
government is hoping to get the last, dlrs 28 million installment 
of a dlrs 185 million loan agreed with IMF in 1996. The country has 
received only three payments so far because of dissatisfaction over 
the government's economic policies. Recently an IMF official said 
Moldova might receive the tranche before the end of the year if it 
cuts state spending and privatizes the energy sector. Lazar said Moldova 
had managed to solve its dlrs 200 million debt to Russia's Gazprom 
when it set up a joint venture in Moscow last week with the government 
of the breakaway region of Trans-Dniester. The new company is called 
Moldovagaz. Gazprom will own a 50 percent stake in the venture, Moldova 
36 percent and Trans-Dniester 14 percent. Moldova will pay back a 
part of its debts by selling bonds of dlrs 90 million for seven years 
and handing over the country's gas assets. Another dlrs 47 million 
will be obtained from the venture's profits and Gazprom will also 
accept food and technical equipment in exchange for the debts. Moldova's 
budget deficit target for 1998 is 4.8 per cent but it has been widening 
because of fallout from Russia's economic crisis. The Moldovan currency, 
the leu, has depreciated sharply in the past two months. The central 
bank has sold about dlrs 100 million to prop it up.
