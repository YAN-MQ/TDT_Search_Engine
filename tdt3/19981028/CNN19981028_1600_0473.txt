An attorney for Olympic gymnast Dominique Moceanu says she's reached 
a Settlement with her parents. The 17-year-old gold medalist had filed 
suit, claiming her parents squandered her fortune. She asked the Texas 
court to declare her an adult, so she could take control of what's 
left. Moceanu's attorney would not disclose details of the settlement, 
but says it is being presented to a judge this afternoon.
