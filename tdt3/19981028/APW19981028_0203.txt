An Australian Rules football player was banned for seven weeks Wednesday 
after being found guilty of smearing blood into an opponent's face. 
John Darling was suspended for smearing his blood into the face of 
rival player Rod Hoare during a Northern Territory Football League 
(NTFL) reserves game on Oct. 18. NTFL general manager Greg Trappett 
said Darling's sentence appeared to be light but said there had been 
evidence that he had been concussed at the time of the incident. ``If 
he had been fully conscious at the time he did it I would have expected 
a much tougher sentence _ between one and two years,'' Trappett said 
Wednesday. ``I mean what he did was disgusting and it raised all sorts 
of questions because I don't think this sort of thing has happened 
in any code of football in Australia.'' A spokeswoman for the Northern 
Territory branch of the Australian Medical Association, Robyn Cahill, 
suggested that Darling, who plays for the suburban Wanderers club, 
should be forced to take a compulsory first aid course as part of 
his sentence. ``It's no good just giving him a rap over the knuckles. 
He, and all footballers for that matter, must be educated as to the 
risks involved with transferring of bodily fluids such as blood,'' 
Cahill said. ``Although I don't know all the circumstances but it 
seems a terrible thing that he did. There is always the risk, although 
small, of transferring of Hepatitis and HIV AIDS like this.''
