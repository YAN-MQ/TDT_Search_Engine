Michael Jordan, the chairman and chief executive of CBS, who led the 
transformation of Westinghouse Corp. from an industrial and broadcasting 
conglomerate into a pure media entity retitled CBS Corp., announced 
his resignation Wednesday. Mel Karmazin, the president, was appointed 
the new top CBS executive. Though the move had been anticipated when 
Karmzain was elevated to the job of chief operating officer last April, 
the timing of Jordan's departure was a mild surprise. CBS officially 
characterized his decision as a retirement, though Jordan said in 
an interview ``I'm not retiring, retiring. I don't have a new job 
right now.'' The ascension of Karmazin to the title of CEO was a transfer 
of title only, according to Karmazin, who said he has been running 
all the operations of the company since April. ``I thought this was 
a non-event,'' Karmazin said in a telephone interview. ``I didn't 
even want to issue a press release. I have been running the company. 
I obviously already had the opportunity to do whatever I wanted to 
do.'' Jordan said the time was right for him to depart because in 
January the company will complete the sell-off of Westinghouse's former 
industrial assets, a role he described as his principle mission since 
he made the decision for Westinghouse to buy CBS in 1995 for $5.4 
billion. He said he is leaving the company in capable hands with Karmazin 
in charge, calling him ``a superb top executive.'' But Jordan acknowledged 
that the two men approached management ``in very different ways'' 
and that his relationship with Karmazin, who has a reputation as an 
aggressive manager, was ``a little stormy.'' Karmazin, who is the 
largest CBS shareholder with 1.5 percent of the more than 700 million 
shares of stock, said the change would mean ``no differences at all 
from an operations point of view.'' He added, ``I don't mean to imply 
Mike's role was not significant at all, but as far as day-to-day operations 
go I will continue to handle them all.'' He said he had a ``great 
relationship'' with Jordan. Several senior CBS executives agreed Wednesday 
that Karmazin has been in total operational control of the company. 
And though by all accounts Jordan still controlled the CBS board of 
directors and the decision to leave now was completely his, one senior 
CBS executive said the shift in power was ``totally inevitable.'' 
The executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, added: ``It just 
happened a little sooner than some people expected. Mel's an impatient 
guy. And he can't work for anybody.'' The CBS board will choose a 
chairman in January. It is widely assumed that it will be Karmazin. 
Karmazin will lead a CBS that has struggled to maintain a prominent 
position among much larger media enterprises that now compete with 
the company especially in the television business. While it owns the 
biggest collection of radio stations in the country, its television 
stations have underperformed the rest of the industry and its network 
has suffered through several years without profits as it continues 
to fight a reputation as a network primarily for older viewers in 
a business where advertisers pay more to reach younger viewers. Karmazin, 
a radio entrepreneur who built his company, Infinity Broadcasting, 
into one of the most successful media companies in the country, joined 
CBS in 1996, after CBS acquired Infinity. At the time, executives 
both inside and outside CBS forecast that Karmazin would, within a 
year or two, take control of CBS, with Jordan departing. Karmazin 
first ran the combined radio operations of Infintity, Westinghouse 
and CBS, along with its business in outdoor advertising. Then Jordan 
appointed him to head CBS' stations division, which had badly lagged 
the stations owned by the other networks. Finally he assumed the title 
of chief operating officer of the company. The senior CBS executive 
said, ``First Mel got radio and outdoor advertising. Then he got the 
stations. Then he got the network. It was just a question of when 
the rest would fall into place.' CBS owns 160 radio stations, 14 television 
stations, two cable channels and an outdoor advertising business. 
Karmazin said these assets give CBS ``the advantage over other media 
companies.'' He said, `` I respect Mike for putting these assets together.'' 
Jordan, 62, joined Westinghouse in 1993 after a career that included 
18 years at PepsiCo, where he rose to the title of president. He said 
he moved to acquire CBS as a way to try to restructure Westinghouse. 
``My speciality is acquiring and putting things together,'' Jordan 
said. ``Our plan first of all was to survive.'' In 1995, he said, 
``We didn't say it, but the company was bankrupt.'' Looking to address 
what he called ``a black hole in the balance sheet of $7 billion, 
which was really $15 billion,'' he decided to start ``trading assets.'' 
Initially he said, he leaned toward retaining both the media and defense- 
oriented companies held by Westinghouse, but he quickly realized the 
latter business was not nearly as sound. So he began aggressively 
selling off all of Westinghouse's nonmedia assets. He said he identified 
radio as ``our best business'' and that Karmazin, radio's other big 
player in the mid-1990s, ``came to us and said let's put our companies 
together.'' Karmazin had become a favorite on Wall Street for his 
management of Infinity and his entry into the CBS fold helped elevate 
the company's stock price. It climbed as high as $36 dollars in the 
past year, but then fell sharply, along with many other media stocks. 
It hit a low of $18, but in August, Karmazin announced a plan both 
for layoffs and for an independent public offering of a separate unit 
of CBS' radio and outdoor advertising, to again be called Infinity 
Broadcasting. In August, CBS announced it would cut 200 to 300 employees 
by the end of the year. Karmazin said Wednesday that the IPO is set 
to take place over the next two months and that it will ``help us 
control our value.'' He added that the network side of CBS, which 
has not been profitable for several years, is improving and he praised 
the work of the president of CBS Television, Leslie Moonves, in making 
gains in prime-time programming. Karmazin also noted that he was criticized 
for overpaying for rights to National Football Leauge games this year 
but cited the addition of the games as an important factor in CBS' 
improvement. Asked what might be the most noticeable change in the 
company now that he has been named CEO, Karmazin joked, ``You'll just 
see more high-rated shows.''
