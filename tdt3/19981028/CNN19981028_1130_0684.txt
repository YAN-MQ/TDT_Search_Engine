For some couples, trying to have a baby can become a stressful experience, 
especially when months or years go by without success. It really takes 
a toll on your life, it takes a toll on your marriage, takes a toll 
on your everyday waking up and going to sleep. Now there's scientific 
evidence learning to manage such stress may make conception more likely. 
A study funded by the national institutes of mental health followed 
almost 200 women who had been trying to conceive for one to two years. 
The program uses a variety of exercises, such as deep relaxation, 
guided imagery and anger management, to help infertile women cope 
with depression and anxiety. In most cases, the mind/body approach 
was not enough to achieve pregnancy on its own. Most women in the 
study got pregnant after combining that approach with conventional 
infertility treatment. For the latest health news online, check out
