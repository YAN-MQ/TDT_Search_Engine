Hurricane Mitch is sitting just off shore in the carribean, pounding 
the region with heavy winds and rain. Most people are not waiting 
for the powerful storm to come ashore. Mexico declared an alert for 
the Yucatan peninsula and evacuated thousands of tourists and residents 
from cancun, cozumel and other vulnerable areas. Forecasters say Mitch 
will probably threaten the entire northwestern carribean for at least 
the next two days. At last report, the storm was parked about 30 miles 
off the coast of honduras. Its winds have now dropped to about 120 
miles per hour. Mitch has dumped up to 25 inches of rain in parts 
of Honduras. Dozens of rivers have flooded there, cutting off access 
to many cities.
