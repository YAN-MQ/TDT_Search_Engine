Abe Hirschfeld, the New York City parking garage magnate who tried 
to ride to the rescue in ending Paula Corbin Jones' lawsuit against 
President Clinton, said Wednesday that he was withdrawing his offer 
to pay Mrs. Jones $1 million to settle the case. He said his efforts 
were over, finished, off the table and not to be renewed. ``The whole 
thing became a shenanigan,'' said Hirschfeld, who described himself 
as thoroughly fed up. ``I thought the country shouldn't be playing 
around with such a thing, this lawsuit,'' he said in an interview 
Wednesday. ``But I withdraw my offer.'' Hirschfeld blamed feuding 
among Mrs. Jones' lawyers about how to apportion the money for his 
decision to rescind the offer. Lawyers for Mrs. Jones and Clinton 
were close earlier this month to settling her sexual misconduct lawsuit 
against him. She had demanded $1 million from Clinton, and the White 
House had gone up to $700,000 from its initial offer of $500,000. 
But with Hirschfeld's offer, Mrs. Jones saw a way earlier this month 
to put together a large package. She increased her demand, asking 
for $1 million from Clinton in addition to the Hirschfeld contribution 
for a total of $2 million. The White House quickly rejected the proposal. 
Privately, White House advisers described Mrs. Jones as unrealistic 
and said they could not be part of any deal in which a third party 
like Hirschfeld paid Mrs. Jones to withdraw her suit because that 
would raise issues of whether the money was a gift to Clinton. As 
a result of the breakdown in negotiations, both sides went ahead with 
arguments Oct. 20 in St. Paul, Minn., before a panel of appeals court 
judges over whether the lawsuit should be reinstated. A federal trial 
judge dismissed Mrs. Jones' lawsuit in April, saying her account of 
being propositioned by Clinton in a Little Rock, Ark., hotel room 
in 1991 did not amount to a legal case of sexual harassment. Mrs. 
Jones' lawyers told the appeals panel that the complaint should be 
allowed to go to a jury for many reasons, not least of which was their 
claim that Clinton had lied under oath to them when he said he had 
not had sexual relations with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
After the arguments, lawyers for both sides said they would still 
try to work out a settlement, although John Whitehead, one of Mrs. 
Jones' lawyers, said Wednesday that talks had not resumed. Whitehead 
said it was difficult to evaluate what effect Hirschfeld's withdrawal 
would have on the negotiations. ``This may complicate things or it 
may well streamline them,'' he said, by emphasizing to Mrs. Jones 
that she must focus solely on whatever terms are offered by the White 
House.
