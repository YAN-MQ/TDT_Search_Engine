General Motors and Chrysler have been cleared in two separate lawsuits 
related to car accidents. A jury said GM was not at fault in the death 
of a Florida teenager when a Chevy S-10 blazer rolled over. The jury 
said GM's seat belt was not defective. Separately, an Arkansas jury 
said Chrysler was not responsible for injuries suffered by a 16-year-old 
girl. Her Jeep Cherokee collided with a train. The family said if 
the Jeep's lift gate had not opened, the girl wouldn't have been thrown 
from the vehicle. The girl was not wearing a seat belt.
