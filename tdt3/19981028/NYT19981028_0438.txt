Stock prices resumed their advance Wednesday in a relatively subdued 
session as investors appraised Brazil's fiscal package and awaited 
key government reports on U.S. wage growth and output. Most averages 
posted gains, though the Dow Jones industrial average retained only 
5.93 points of what at one time was a gain of nearly 67 points. It 
did, however, break a run of three straight declines, closing at 8,371.97. 
The Nasdaq composite index had the day's best gain, rising 19.72 points, 
or 1.15 percent, to 1,737.35, as its technology stocks gathered strength 
in the afternoon. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.75 
points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 1,068.09. ``The market is having 
to deal with some cross-currents,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief strategist 
at Advest Group. He said that Brazil, which announced an austerity 
plan, seemed to be ``getting its act together'' but that declining 
consumer confidence in the United States was a growing concern. Nonetheless, 
most retail and department store shares rebounded, with Wal-Mart Stores 
rising 1 9/16, to 64 13/16, reversing the bulk of its loss on Tuesday 
when the Conference Board said consumer confidence slipped in October 
for the fourth month in a row. Most bank and brokerage stocks also 
moved higher, paced by J.P. Morgan, up 1{, to 91[, and Charles Schwab, 
up 1~, to 44 1/16. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks, 
which has had a run-up of nearly 20 percent in the last couple of 
weeks, made a strong comeback in the afternoon but still could not 
eke out a gain. It fell three-hundredths of a percent, with 890 components 
up and 874 down. Clare Zempel, chief strategist at Robert Baird in 
Milwaukee, was among those regarding the general market advance of 
recent weeks as more likely to be a building block than a bear-market 
trap for the unwary. He pointed to the decline in short-term interest 
rates in the United States and signs of economic stability in the 
Far East that he said ``strongly suggest that the worst'' of this 
year's stock decline is past. As for Brazil, Zempel said it would 
probably ``muddle through.'' Brazil's Bovespa stock index retreated 
six-tenths of a percent Wednesday as investors evaluated its plan 
to cut its $60 billion budget deficit, the centerpiece of an effort 
to restore its credit and avoid devaluing its currency, the real. 
Other overseas markets were mostly lower as well, with main stock 
indexes down 2.53 percent in Frankfurt, 1.61 percent in Paris, seven-tenths 
of a percent in London and 2.2 percent in Tokyo. Stocks rose 1.51 
percent in Hong Kong. Although foreign economic and financial turmoil 
has in the last 15 months supplanted Washington's economic reports 
as the dominant market influence, the government's first estimate 
of gross domestic product for the third quarter, to be announced tomorrow, 
will be closely watched for signs that the economy's slowdown might 
be accelerating, said Rosanne Cahn, equity economist at Credit Suisse 
First Boston. Many analysts already expect the Federal Reserve to 
cut interest rates again, perhaps as early as mid-November. A second 
focal point will be the Labor Department's release Thursday of the 
employment cost index, a quarterly measure of wage pressure that, 
like the figures on gross domestic product, has implications for corporate 
profits. Rising technology stocks Wednesday included Sun Microsystems, 
up 3 1/16, to 56 11/16; Dell Computer and Cisco Systems, each up 2[, 
to 64| and 62~, respectively; and Sun Microsystems, up 3 1/16, to 
56 11/16. Oil stocks were mixed, with Mobil down } after reporting 
a 45 percent earnings decline, a bit less than expected. Drugs were 
mostly higher, paced by Warner-Lambert, up 2 13/16, and Schering-Plough, 
up 1~, to 102[. DuPont was the Dow's biggest loser, slumping 2 11/16, 
to 56~, apparently reflecting a negative discussion of the company's 
prospects in The Wall Street Journal. On the New York Stock Exchange, 
declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by 1,535 to 1,456, with 
new highs exceeding new lows for the second consecutive session, 30 
to 23. Volume was a moderate 677.59 million shares traded.
