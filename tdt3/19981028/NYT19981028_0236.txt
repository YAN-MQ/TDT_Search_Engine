Armed with little more than a sheaf of recipes, a glue gun, some dried 
flowers and a puritanical zeal for modern home-keeping, Martha Stewart 
has built a multimedia empire worth $200 million, by one conservative 
estimate. Thus, it comes as no surprise that pretenders are cropping 
up thicker than sprouts on a Chia Pet. Haunted by Ms. Stewart's success 
and eager to promote their own domains, seven gurus of the homely 
arts gathered last week in New York for a Halloween photo shoot. These 
arbiters of design and entertaining, cooking and crafts were armed 
with enough moss, glitter, candles, dry ice, scarecrows and baled 
straw to raise Mrs. Beeton from the dead, and were escorted by assistants, 
publicity agents, and stylists. Most have already written books, and 
landed half-hour slots in the rapidly expanding souffle of life-style 
television. But they're just treading water compared with Ms. Stewart, 
a polar-ice-breaking juggernaut who has churned out 22 books and by 
January will fill five hours of television programming a week. Why 
the audience? Home-decorating shows are soothing _ like those devoted 
to golf or bass fishing. Burton Jablin, the programming chief for 
the fledgling Home and Garden network (HGTV), said that his company 
had predicted a downturn in morning ratings the day President Clinton's 
grand jury testimony was shown. Instead, there was an increase. ``People 
want something safe and apart from what's out there,'' Jablin said. 
``We call it `informational escapism.''' Caroline Goldstein, the author 
of ``Do It Yourself: Home Improvement in the 20th Century,'' said 
shelter advice is, and has always been, about ``wanting to be upper 
middle class.'' Then again, some people just don't aspire to Ms. Stewart's 
``casual country buffet for 40'' or $750 German glass tree ornaments. 
Annabelle Gurwitch, a host of TBS' life-style parody show, ``Dinner 
and a Movie,'' said Ms. Stewart and her ilk were depressing: ``Watching 
some of those life-style shows is like watching porn. There are some 
very tantalizing things happening in front of me that I know that 
I'm never going to do in my lifetime.'' But for those who have the 
time and inclination to gild their pumpkins, homemaking is back. ``Domesticity 
for a long time got a dour, matronly rap,'' said Katie Brown, 35, 
the anti-Martha who is the host of Lifetime's ``Next Door With Katie 
Brown.'' ``It was embarrassing to say, `I baked these.' Women of my 
generation are embracing nesting again.'' What does this Gen X'er 
bring to the table: she uses a shower curtain as a tablecloth. A healthy 
economy helped spark the explosion of decorating shows, which range 
from impressive to infuriating. ``There are a lot of wannabes out 
there,'' said Chris Casson Madden, 50, the author of two coffee-table 
books, ``Kitchens'' and its sequel, ``Bathrooms.'' ``There are businessmen 
thinking, `Let's create the next one,' like Milli Vanilli. But this 
isn't as easy as lip-synching a song.'' Then again, maybe it is. Ms. 
Madden has a program called ``Interiors by Design'' on HGTV whose 
slim content includes house tours and discussions of barrel chairs 
and passementerie. Now, she is planning her home-decorating empire. 
``I'll probably do a fragrance at some point, but it doesn't have 
to be tomorrow,'' she said. The number of imitators grows weekly as 
HGTV, Lifetime, Discovery, TBS, Romance Classics and E! scramble to 
fill time slots. Many will be chosen. Few, if any, will succeed. But 
here are some helpful tips, including a few from Martha Stewart herself, 
who says, `I'm not usually in the business of giving free consultations 
to competitors'' CHOOSE A NICHE _ Barbara Smith, a New York restaurateur 
and former model, is the host of ``B. Smith With Style,'' a syndicated 
show. She has emerged as the African-American Martha Stewart. ``My 
show has more rhythm,'' said Ms. Smith, 49. Her glossy 1995 tome, 
``B. Smith's Entertaining and Cooking for Friends,'' features Southern 
recipes, no-frills party tips and beaming children in red and yellow 
Kwanzaa outfits. Then there is Mary Emmerling, 56, the Country Martha 
Stewart. Ms. Emmerling is the host of an HGTV show called ``Country 
at Home.'' (Though she glorifies the American West, Ms. Emmerling 
has lived in Georgetown in Washington D.C, Bridgehampton, NY, and, 
for 30 years, Manhattan. Ms. Brown, an actress/waitress turned cool 
camp-crafts counselor, landed ``Next Door With Katie Brown'' last 
year. She's a sunnier Martha, in the Katie Couric mold, who never 
stops acting casual, even when sewing fabric butterflies for an indoor 
picnic or making handmade paper in a blender from boiled newspaper 
pulp and rose petals. Colin Cowie, a celebrity party planner, is kind 
of a Rococo Martha. ``I'm on a mission to reinforce and reinstate 
our social graces,'' said Cowie, who gives his age as 36. He is the 
author of the voyeuristic paperweights ``Weddings'' and ``Effortless 
Elegance.'' Not always hands-on, Cowie believes that effortless elegance 
is achieved by having a chef assist him during cooking segments of 
``Everyday Elegance With Colin Cowie'' on Romance Classics. If the 
going gets tough, he's not above plunking a waiter in a cab to fetch 
Indian takeout. A glance around the cable spectrum reveals slots open 
for a Latina Martha, a Sporty Martha and a Rock 'n' Roll Martha. Martha 
says: ``I never wanted to go after a niche. I want to teach as many 
people as possible.'' OUT-MARTHA MARTHA Ms. Madden and Bari Lynn, 
the former home correspondent for ``Good Morning America,'' have taken 
on Martha mano a mano, down to the casual attire and the straw-basket-blond 
hair. ``The dream is to turn me into a brand name and license products: 
crystal, china, window treatments, bedding,'' said Ms. Lynn, 35, who 
is looking for her own television show. Martha says: ``Why anybody 
would want to copy me or replicate me is kind of crazy.'' TAPE A SEGMENT 
ON `OPRAH' _ ``Appearing on `Oprah' was a turning point,'' said Ms. 
Madden, who landed her own show after making herself invaluable to 
the busy Ms. Winfrey, redesigning her private office to include watercolors 
of Ms. Winfrey's dogs. Cowie said he is now recognized at airports, 
thanks to his annual ``Oprah'' appearance. ``I get a whole hour with 
her,'' he boasted. Other Stewart wannabes have appeared on ``Entertainment 
Tonight'' ( Cowie), ``Good Morning America'' (Ms. Madden, Ms. Lynn) 
and the ``Today'' show (Lynette Jennings). The telegenic Ms. Smith 
has appeared on ``Oprah,'' the ``Today'' show and ``Good Morning America.'' 
Martha says: ``If you're an expert in something very specific, you 
may be invited on my show.'' NAME DROP _ Cowie, who is doing an all-Prada 
Halloween wedding this weekend in Beverly Hills, Calif., has been 
a nuptial coordinator for such taste mavens as Hugh Hefner, Kenny 
G., Paula Abdul and Charlie Sheen. ``Because of the celebrity angle,'' 
he said, ``I have been inundated with offers to do licensing agreements.'' 
Ms. Brown's press kit mentions that she has catered for Quentin Tarantino, 
Mira Sorvino and Diane Keaton. Ms. Madden trumpets that she is Ms. 
Winfrey's favorite designer. One of the most popular names to drop 
is that of the poet Maya Angelou. She was touted as a guest, client 
or book subject by at least four of the seven interviewed. Not to 
be outdone, Martha says: ``Even Oprah has said to me, `Where do you 
get your ideas?''' EXPLOIT A COLORFUL PAST _ Ms. Stewart, 57, was 
variously a model, a stockbroker and a caterer before she turned to 
life-style management. Ms. Jennings, 50, studied architecture and 
owned a company that actually built homes. Ms. Smith's career as a 
model has given her poise, and 12 years of running her own restaurants 
in New York, Washington and Sag Harbor have made her comfortable with 
a wooden spoon. Ms. Brown said she learned cooking tips by pestering 
chefs during her years in New York as a waitress. A childhood in Kitwe, 
Zambia, and studies in pharmacy provided Cowie with inspiration to 
become, as his biography states, an ``international arbiter of taste.'' 
And Ms. Madden's success suggests that a background in public relations 
works, too. She spent time in the publicity departments of Random 
House, G.P. Putnam's Sons and Simon &AMP; Schuster before becoming 
a design writer. ``I know a trend when I see one,'' she said. Martha 
would like to own up to a more colorful past, but says: ``I don't 
remember the last time I made a mistake.'' FIND A NEW GIMMICK _ So 
far, no one has come up with a trademark to match Ms. Stewart's signature 
phrase, ``It's a good thing.'' But that's not for want of trying. 
Ms. Emmerling is the doyenne of five-minute decorating and promotes 
decor that might best be termed rack and stack. Check her book ``Quick 
Decorating'' for details, but it involves piles of books, things hanging 
from coat racks and folded blankets. ``Folding just comes naturally 
to me,'' she said. Ms. Madden so believes women need personal spaces 
that she wrote a book, which includes an exegesis on a nun's adobe 
cell in Santa Fe, N.M. Cowie, who employs the word fabulous as generously 
as a truckstop waitress doles out ketchup, has elevated table-top 
decor (seafood topiary anyone?) to an art worthy of a Hallmark card. 
Martha says: ``I look for what isn't out there. My next book is about 
hors d'oeuvres. There's a need out there for a good handbook on hors 
d'oeuvres.'' GET INTO PRINT _ Ms. Lynn shot her own photos for ``Eclectic 
Living,'' while Ms. Smith hired Andrea Gentl and Martin Hyers, a husband-and-wife 
team who have worked for Martha Stewart Living. Ms. Madden has one-upped 
them all: her editor at Clarkson Potter, Annetta Hannah, used to be 
Ms. Stewart's editor. Cowie and Ms. Madden say they will start their 
own magazines within a year. Ms. Brown, the new spokeswoman for Arm 
&AMP; Hammer baking soda, said she currently has book offers from 
21 publishers. Martha says: ``Whether it's as simple as roasting a 
chicken or as complicated as making Jean-Georges' chocolate delight 
dessert, readers want to know the real way and no short cuts. People 
never put the real way in their books.'' GET YOUR OWN SHOW _ Without 
a weekly show, you're just another guest stylist. Ms. Brown has managed 
to leapfrog her competition. Come January, her show will expand to 
five half-hour segments a week. Ms. Jennings, a pioneer in the genre, 
has spent 10 years on the Discovery Channel. Her highly professional 
series, ``Lynette Jennings Design,'' combines instructional home tours 
with practical decorating tips. ``I consider myself more of a teacher 
than a celebrity, a hostess or a star,'' said Ms. Jennings, the Ted 
Koppel of life style. Martha says: ``I surf the networks at night, 
seeing how other people are doing. People are not being offered quality 
programming except for mine.'' RESTORE, RECYCLE, RE-USE _ Even Ms. 
Stewart in recent weeks has recycled standbys like ``How to Load a 
Dishwasher'' and ``How to Hang a Backyard Clothesline.'' How can any 
mere mortal consistently come up with new ideas? ``Everything's recycled 
these days,'' Ms. Emmerling said. ``I don't care who you are _ you 
can't do it all yourself. You get it from magazines, from books, from 
store windows. Why did I see `Out of Africa' 20 times? I wanted to 
see that living room again.'' Martha says: ``I come up with 25 ideas 
a day.'' THINK FRAGRANCE _ Create a brand, and market it shamelessly. 
Not everyone will have the longevity of Ms. Stewart, whose line of 
Everyday sheets and towels for Kmart is expected to top $1 billion 
in sales this fiscal year. ``Except for Martha, it comes and goes 
for everyone,'' said Ms. Emmerling, who lost her line of sheets for 
J.C. Penny and is now down to wallpaper and her American Country West 
furnishings. While most empire-builders want to expand quickly, Ms. 
Jennings held off until this year, when she became the spokeswoman 
for Home Depot and signed deals with Delta (for crafts products), 
Crown Craft (for bedding and throw rugs) and Time-Life (for books 
and videos). ``We wanted to wait until we could work with the top 
people in each field,'' she said. Martha says: ``I must have turned 
down 44 perfumes. I've never licensed my name. That is not something 
that is going to be fabulous.'' SPAWN A PARODY _ Ms. Stewart is a 
target because of her perfectionism and apparent lack of humor, as 
anyone who watched her flock a Christmas tree with cotton candy on 
the David Letterman show can attest. So far, none of the seven pretenders 
to Martha's throw rug has proved worthy of parody. But what pleasures 
lie ahead? Martha says: ``Love the late-night jokes. But the parodies 
are so stupid. I could do those better myself.''
