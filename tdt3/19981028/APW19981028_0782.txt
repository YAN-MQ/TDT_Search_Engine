A group of Serbian hackers, who call themselves ``Black Hand,'' apparently 
intruded the website of Croatia's daily Vjesnik on Wednesday, deleting 
its home page and causing the system to crash, the paper said. Instead 
of Vjesnik's ``welcome page'' (www.vjesnik.com), there appeared a 
sign: ``Black Hand home page.'' The group also left a message saying: 
``The last thing we want to do is to threaten, but we will stop any 
twisting of the truth in any possible way,'' Vjesnik said in a statement. 
Earlier this month, the Black Hand group publicly declared a computer 
war against anti-Serb websites. They first focused on Albanian sites, 
saying they wanted to ``remove (ethnic) Albanian lies from the Internet.'' 
The group's actions began as NATO threatened Yugoslavia with airstrikes 
unless it stops its crackdown on Albanians in its southern province 
of Kosovo. Vjesnik is a state-run daily and considered a mouthpiece 
of the government. The Black Hand obviously sees it as being anti-Serb. 
Vjesnik said hackers didn't enter other pages, but they caused system 
crash. The website should nevertheless be back later in the day, it 
said. Vjesnik is one of the few Croatian papers with a daily updated 
website. When the site was launched two weeks ago, the move was followed 
by heavy propaganda commercials in the paper and on state-run television.
