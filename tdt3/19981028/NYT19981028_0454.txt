The federal government officially closed the books Wednesday on the 
fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, saying it ran a $70 billion surplus, 
the first time since 1969 that Washington spent less than it took 
in. The final tally, announced by President Clinton at a news conference 
at the White House, matched precisely the administration's last estimate, 
made four weeks ago. Relative to the size of the economy, it was the 
biggest surplus since 1956. Clinton used the occasion to continue 
his assault on Republicans as bent on using the surpluses projected 
for coming years to pay for tax cuts, and to repeat his demand that 
the money be set aside until Congress and the administration settle 
on a plan to shore up Social Security. Under intense pressure from 
Clinton and Democrats in Congress, Republicans abandoned plans to 
push through a big tax cut this year. But they have vowed to enact 
one next year, and both parties agreed to spend more than $20 billion 
of the current year's projected surplus of $80 billion on a variety 
of programs that they deemed emergencies. The Congressional Budget 
Office has projected surpluses for the next decade, totaling $1.55 
trillion. Most of that money, however, will come from payroll taxes 
that are intended for Social Security. But with the economy appearing 
to weaken and the stock market no longer generating the big capital 
gains that led to a surge in tax revenues over the last few years, 
some economists are questioning whether the surpluses will be as big 
as currently estimated. June E. O'Neill, the budget office's director, 
said Wednesday that she would leave the job at the conclusion of her 
four-year appointment early next year. She said her decision was unrelated 
to criticism from Republicans that she had consistently underestimated 
the size of the surplus.
