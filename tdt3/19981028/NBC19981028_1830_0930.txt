Another woman that will closely watch tomorrow's liftoff is a pilot 
named jerrie cobb. She knew John Glenn back at the beginning of the 
program, and she, toorx wanted to go into space, but she didn't get 
that opportunity. More on that from NBC's Anne Thompson. Jerrie cobb 
has always flown in the shadow of John Glenn. That was my dearest 
dream, that I'd get to go with John Glenn. But more than 30 years 
after testing to go into space, cobb still has gotten no higher than 
the clouds. I thought that those who went into space would be just 
on ability, not on gender. Cobb had the ability -- four world aviation 
records, more than 10,000 hours of flight time -- twice as many as 
Glenn. In 1960, at age 29, she was one of a select group of women 
recruited for astronaut testing. The press dubbed them "the Mercury 
13" -- women who passed the same grueling and unusual tests as the 
men. Let's see, swallowing three feet of rubber hose, injecting water 
into your inner eardrum to freeze it to induce vertigo, electric charges 
into the arms and the legs. At a time when only a third of American 
women worked, the Mercury 13 were treated as a novelty. Boy, isn't 
that a honey. Say, she is a honey! Meet miss jerrie cobb. They were 
mostly interested in things like my measurements. Could I cook and 
did I have a lot of boyfriends? All jerrie cared about was going into 
space. But in 1961, NASA grounded her dream, insisting astronauts 
had to be military test pilots -- a men's club at the time. Devastated 
by NASA's refusal to make her an astronaut, jerrie went back to her 
first love, flying, and, in the sky, found a new mission for her life. 
For the last three decades, she's lived in the Amazon, flying humanitarian 
aid to local tribes. Help me welcome and honor jerrie cobb. Now 67 
-- 10 years younger than John Glenn -- cobb is back in america to 
lobby NASA one last time. But so far, NASA is unmoved. If we flew 
astronauts based on public support, we'd fly Leonardo DiCaprio. Still, 
jerrie believes she'll have her shot. They said I had the right stuff 
then. It was just the wrong time. And I'm just trusting that it's 
the right time now. And my dream will come true. a dream she hopes 
will take her beyond the clouds. Anne Thompson, NBC news, sun city, 
Florida.
