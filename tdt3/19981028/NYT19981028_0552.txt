Still jubilant after his baseball team won the World Series last week, 
George Steinbrenner announced Wednesday that he would donate $200,000 
from the Yankee Foundation to hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico 
and the Dominican Republic. Half of the money will be used to rebuild 
a hospital in the Dominican town of San Pedro de Macoris _ the hometown 
of Chicago Cubs star Sammy Sosa _ and half will help rebuild a center 
for the elderly in Gurabo, Puerto Rico. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who 
visited Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic earlier this month 
to survey the damage from Hurricane Georges, promptly hailed Steinbrenner, 
the principal owner of the Yankees, as a hero. The mayor also took 
the opportunity to inform New Yorkers _ many of whom have bridled 
at Steinbrenner's talk of moving his team from the Bronx _ that the 
Yankees owner cared about them. ``To have that kind of generosity 
and that kind of caring happen spontaneously is rare,'' the mayor 
said during a news conference with Steinbrenner in Washington Heights. 
``I want to thank Steinbrenner very, very much for caring so much 
about the people of our city, and about the people of Puerto Rico 
and the Dominican Republic.'' Steinbrenner said he would send Bernie 
Williams, the Yankees' star outfielder, to deliver two checks next 
week. ``It's just a small thing in these times, when the Yankees and 
all the city of New York are celebrating our victory, to think of 
others in need,'' Steinbrenner said. But he stopped talking when reporters 
asked whether he planned to move the Yankees from the Bronx. ``I'm 
not going to get into that,'' he said. ``Don't drive me away.''
