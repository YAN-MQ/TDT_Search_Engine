Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's new government team moved into their 
offices Wednesday promising to focus on ties with Germany's European 
partners and the fight against unemployment. A day after Schroeder 
formally took office, his Cabinet ministers completed the shift to 
a younger, left-leaning government that includes the once-radical 
Greens for the first time. Greens leader Joschka Fischer, who entered 
politics in protest at the Vietnam War, took over the foreign ministry. 
With limited foreign experience from his time as a Greens lawmaker, 
he said, ``I'm a person who likes learn.'' Shortly before traveling 
to Paris for his first trip as foreign minister, he called France 
``the most important partner'' in Europe, a principle upheld by former 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, but he also singled out British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair as an ally. He voiced concern about Russia's stability 
in view of the country's financial crisis. And filling the relationship 
with the United States with new meaning was important, Fischer said, 
though he did not elaborate. Oskar Lafontaine, the powerful chairman 
of Schroeder's Social Democrats, took over as finance minister declaring 
the fight against 10-percent joblessness ``the most important task 
of German economic and financial policy.'' He called for shorter working 
hours to spread jobs around and repeated an appeal for governments 
of leading industrial nations to band together and stabilize financial 
markets. Lafontaine, an old-style leftist who favors a stronger social 
welfare state, is widely seen as competing for power in the new government 
with Schroeder, who won Sept. 27 election partly because of his centrist, 
pro-business reputation. Taking over federal law enforcement was Otto 
Schily, an attorney for left-wing terrorists in the 1970s who nowadays 
is tougher on law and order than many other Social Democrats. As interior 
minister, he is in charge of drafting a landmark law scrapping the 
principle that only people of German blood have an automatic right 
to citizenship.
