Doctors at Okayama University Hospital in western Japan carried out 
the country's first lung transplant from living donors Wednesday. 
Organ transplants have been extremely rare in Japan because of a previous 
law that recognized death only after a patient's heart stopped beating. 
But at that point organs such as hearts and lungs are usually unsuitable 
for transplant. A year ago, a new law was passed to recognize brain 
death. Still, the idea of removing organs still meets tremendous resistance 
because of a widespread distrust toward doctors as well as cultural 
superstition about cutting into corpses. Not a single transplant has 
been performed in Japan from brain-dead donors. In Wednesday's surgery, 
a 24-year-old woman with an incurable lung disease received half of 
her 48-year-old mother's left lung and one-third of her 21-year-old 
sister's right lung. All three, whom the hospital did not identify, 
were in stable condition after the nine-hour surgery by a team of 
20 doctors led by Dr. Nobuyoshi Shimizu, said a hospital official, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The lung capacity for the recipient 
was expected to recover to about 52 percent, the newspaper Yomiuri 
said in its Wednesday editions. In the last month before surgery, 
an artificial r spirator was helping her breathe. The donors' lung 
functions will be reduced by about 20 percent, but they will be able 
to lead regular lives, the paper said. A 1996 medical study found 
that Japanese doctors discovered about 400 patients requiring lung 
transplants during a two-year period, with as many as 3,000 patients 
now awaiting lung transplants, the Yomiuri said. Doctors here have 
performed lung transplants before but never using organs from a living 
donor. The most common organ transplants from dead donors carried 
out in Japan are kidney and cornea transplants.
