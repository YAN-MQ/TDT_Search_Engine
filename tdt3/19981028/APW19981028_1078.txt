Lawyers close to attempts to extradite Gen. Augusto Pinochet to Spain 
were disheartened but defiant following the quashing in London of 
Spanish arrest warrants against the former Chilean dictator. ``I was 
very optimistic until today,'' said lawyer Virginia Diaz who has worked 
closely on the case. Also Tuesday some two thousand human rights activists 
gathered in Columbus Square in central Madrid to hold a 24-hour vigil 
calling for Pinochet's extradition to Spain. ``What has happened in 
Britain is shameful,'' said the leader of the United Left party Julio 
Anguita at the vigil that was punctuated by chants of ``Pinochet Assassin.'' 
Earlier Tuesday London's High Court ruled that Pinochet could not 
be prosecuted outside of Chile for crimes committed when he ruled 
the country after ousting an elected government in 1973 until 1990. 
The court quashed arrest warrants issued by Spanish Judge Baltasar 
Garzon that had kept Pinochet detained in a London clinic since Oct. 
16. The warrants were a first step towards extraditing the ailing 
general to Spain to stand trial for genocide, terrorism and torture. 
``We were surprised by the ruling'' said Diaz who has worked closely 
with Garzon and argues that international law clearly rules out immunity 
in cases of crimes against humanity. ``We are not talking about a 
little bit of corruption, but the killing, torture and disappearance 
of thousands of people,'' she said. Nonetheless Diaz said she was 
still hopeful with regards to an appeal on the immunity question that 
is expected to be filed in London Monday. Pinochet remains under guard 
pending the appeal, with a hearing set for Friday for his application 
for release on bail. Meanwhile, the attempt to bring the former dictator 
to trial in Spain could be indirectly quashed via a related ruling 
by the Spanish National Court. A panel of jurists from the National 
Court, to which Garzon is attached, was due to begin discussing Thursday 
whether crimes such as genocide that took place outside of Spain are 
within the jurisdiction of Spanish judges. Over the last two years 
Garzon and another National Court judge have been gathering evidence 
into the murder, torture and disappearance of thousands during the 
military juntas that ruled Chile and Argentina in the 1970s and 1980s. 
Diaz said she feared the London ruling might influence the Spanish 
panel in its decision that is expected Friday. A ruling against Spanish 
jurisdiction for Chilean crime would make the appeal against Tuesday's 
quashing of the arrest warrants difficult to sustain. ``I am very 
hopeful,'' Chilean Dora Carreno said to the crowd in Colombus Square. 
``We have been fighting for 25 years and we are not going to stop 
here'' Carreno, the sister of a woman disappeared during Pinochet's 
regime in Argentina, added ``For the relatives of the victims every 
step however small is important.'' Some of those gathered at the vigil 
in Madrid planned to camp out all night and through Thursday until 
the National Court began discussing the jurisdiction issue.
