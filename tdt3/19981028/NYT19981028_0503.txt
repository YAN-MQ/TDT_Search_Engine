James Goldman, who wrote the Broadway play ``The Lion in Winter'' 
and the book for the Stephen Sondheim musical ``Follies,'' died Wednesday. 
He was 71 and lived in Manhattan. He suffered a heart attack in the 
lobby of his apartment building and was taken to Lenox Hill Hospital. 
He never regained consciousness, said his wife, Barbara. Goldman was 
a screenwriter and novelist as well as playwright. In 1968 he won 
an Academy Award for his adaptation of ``The Lion in Winter.'' A revival 
of that play is scheduled to open in February at the Roundabout Theater 
starring Laurence Fishburne and Stockard Channing. A historical play 
about the 12th-century English ruler Henry II and his estranged wife, 
Eleanor of Aquitaine, and their battle over succession, ``The Lion 
in Winter'' had only a brief run on Broadway in 1966, though the leading 
roles were played by Robert Preston and Rosemary Harris. Two years 
later, the play was turned into a popular movie starring Peter O'Toole 
and Katharine Hepburn, who shared the Academy Award for best actress 
with Barbra Streisand (for ``Funny Girl''). Although Goldman covered 
a wide variety of subjects, history was a specialty. In addition to 
``The Lion in Winter,'' he wrote the screenplay for ``Nicholas and 
Alexandra'' (1971) and a novel, ``Myself as Witness,'' about King 
John, who ruled England in the 13th century. Two years ago his play 
about Tolstoy was presented in London. He was born in Chicago and 
graduated from the University of Chicago. During postgraduate work 
at Columbia University he was drafted into the Army. After he was 
discharged he decided to become a playwright. His play ``They Might 
Be Giants'' was produced by Joan Littlewood in London in 1961 and 
was later turned into a movie starring George C. Scott and Joanne 
Woodward. With his younger brother, William, a novelist and screenwriter, 
he wrote ``Blood, Sweat &AMP; Stanley Poole,'' a comedy about life 
in the Army. It was produced on Broadway in 1961. The following year 
the Goldman brothers collaborated on the book for the John Kander 
musical ``A Family Affair,'' with James Goldman also writing the lyrics 
with Kander. In 1965 Sondheim asked Goldman if he had an idea for 
a musical. Goldman said he had thought about writing one about a reunion, 
perhaps of graduates from a college like Vassar, until he read a newspaper 
item about a reunion of Ziegfeld Follies actresses. In its earliest 
phase, the show was a murder mystery called ``The Girls Upstairs.'' 
Gradually it evolved into ``Follies.'' In 1966, Goldman and Sondheim 
also collaborated on a television musical, ``Evening Primrose,'' based 
on a John Collier story about people living secretly in a department 
store. ``Follies,'' which opened on Broadway in 1971, was, in Sondheim's 
words, ``a dream play, a memory piece.'' The show, produced by Harold 
Prince and directed by Prince and Michael Bennett, won the New York 
Drama Critics Circle award as best musical and ran for 522 performances. 
It came to be regarded as a milestone in the composer's career. Subsequently 
it was revived in a concert version in New York and was fully staged 
in 1987 in London, receiving the Evening Standard Award and the Olivier 
Award as best musical. A revival of ``Follies'' presented last spring 
at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J., had been a Broadway 
possibility. Goldman was also writing the book and lyrics for a new 
musical (with Larry Grossman), based on the novel ``Tom Jones.'' His 
other screenplays included ``Robin and Marian'' (Richard Lester's 
Robin Hood movie starring Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn) and ``White 
Nights'' (with Mikhail Baryshnikov). He wrote four novels, ``Waldorf,'' 
``The Man From Greek and Roman,'' ``Myself as Witness'' and ``Fulton 
County.'' He adapted several classics for television, including ``Oliver 
Twist'' and ``Anna Karenina.'' In addition to his wife and brother, 
both of Manhattan, he is survived by two children, Julia and Matthew, 
from a previous marriage.
