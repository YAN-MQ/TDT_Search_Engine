A leading economic organization is forecasting a deepening recession 
for Japan. The Paris-based organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development says Japan's gross domestic product will shrink by more 
than 2.5 percent this year. This revises an earlier prediction of 
less than one percent. Economists say any recovery next year will 
be minimal.
