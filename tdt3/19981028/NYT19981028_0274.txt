Torrential rain and pounding surf battered the Hondorus and Belize 
coasts Wednesday as powerful Hurricane Mitch edged closer toward land. 
After achieving rank as the fourth-strongest Hurricane of record in 
the Atlantic basin, Mitch slowly weakened Wednesday as a portion of 
its circulation moved over Central America. Hurricane forecasters 
expect the slow westward drift of Mitch to continue Thursday, bringing 
the tropical cyclone's center close to the Belize coast. On the U.S. 
mainland, gusty breezes from the northwest will direct cooler air 
into the Northeast behind a departing front. Residual moisture in 
the lowest few thousand feet of the atmosphere will cause clouds and 
spotty showers to linger over the New England mountains. Meanwhile, 
air descending the higher terrain will help dissipate the clouds near 
the Northeast coast, producing intervals of sunshine. Unseasonable 
warmth and ample sunshine will cover Florida and much of the Southeast 
on Thursday as high pressure at 20,000 feet thwarts inclement weather 
from the region. Partial sunshine will extend across the southern 
Plains and the lower Mississippi Valley but as an approaching cold 
front lifts the humid air in place, isolated strong thunderstorms 
will erupt from central Texas to Missouri. Showers and a few thunderstorms 
will also accompany a jet stream disturbance moving from the northern 
Plains to the western Great Lakes. Elsewhere, low pressure over Nevada 
will generate clouds and showers across the west-central Rockies while 
partly to mostly sunny skies extend along the Pacific Coast. Focus: 
Self-Destruction Hurricane Mitch which has been moving very little 
while battering the coast of Honduras, may be sowing the seeds of 
its own destruction. The gusty winds of a hurricane stir up the ocean 
along the path of the storm. The mixing of the ocean brings cooler 
water from below to the surface. For several days, in the wake of 
a typical hurricane the cooler ocean water produces an inhospitable 
environment for another hurricane to form. Because Hurricane Mitch 
has moved little during the last few days, the cool water that it's 
motions have raised from below are contributing to its own gradual 
weakening.
