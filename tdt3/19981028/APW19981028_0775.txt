Egypt has upgraded its diplomatic mission in Iran in a sign of thawing 
ties, Egyptian and Iranian diplomats said Wednesday. Egypt and Iran 
severed ties after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Egypt maintains an 
interests section in Tehran, which works from the Italian Embassy. 
Mohammed Rifa'a, a career diplomat who holds the rank of ambassador, 
was sent to Tehran last month to head Egypt's interests section. He 
is the highest-ranking Egyptian diplomat to serve in Tehran since 
the revolution and replaces a junior diplomat. Rifa'a was appointed 
after a series of meetings between the foreign ministers of the two 
countries, which have been working to upgrade relations. Egypt is 
eager to improve relations, but wants Iran to end its alleged support 
for fundamentalist Egyptian groups trying to topple the secular regime 
of President Hosni Mubarak. Iran has denied supporting the Egyptian 
radicals.
