Less than a week to go before the midterm elections. And the republican 
party has unveiled something of an October surprise, hard-hitting 
new TV ads that raise the Monica Lewinsky issue. NBC's David Bloom 
joins me now with more. Tom, the White House tonight confronts a surprise, 
final week, $10 million republican advertising blitz, aimed at making 
Mr. Clinton's trustworthiness the number one issue in many tight congressional 
races. But a new NBC news poll suggests the abrupt change in tactics 
could backfire on republicans. The republicans' tough, new, nationwide 
TV ad campaign makes the case that mr. Clinton is untrustworthy, and 
that "balanced leadership" demands a Republican Congress. Should we 
reward not telling the truth? That is the question of this election. 
Reward Bill Clinton or vote republican. At the White House, President 
Clinton argued he should "be judged on his whole record," and accused 
republicans of trying to distract attention away from real issues, 
such as social security. I'm not trying to sugarcoat the fact that 
I made a mistake and that I didn't want anybody to know about it. 
Vice President Gore called the republican ad blitz an act of desperation. 
Attacking the president and investigating the president has apparently 
become an obsession with the republicans. Nervous republicans admit 
privately there's a danger the new ads could drive scandal-wary swing 
voters to the polls to vote democrat. For example, in a new NBC news/"Wall 
Street Journal" poll out tonight -- 68% disapprove of the way congressional 
republicans have handled the lewinsky matter. And 71% now believe 
Mr. Clinton should not be impeached. But the close races, especially 
in the south, republican candidates are only too happy to Se adds 
that play up the scandal. Remember, it is your choice. Vote republican. 
People are very frustrated with Bill Clinton and the presidency right 
now. Tonight the White House is planning a counteroffensive and both 
sides admit that they cannot match the republicans. The president 
says he is trying to atone for his mistakes. tom. Thanks very much.
