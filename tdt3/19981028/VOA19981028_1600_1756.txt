You're listening to "VOA Now." I'm Tom Crosby along with Susan Yackie. 
We're coming to you from Washington. It's 21 hours 30 Universal Time 
and this is "VOA News Now." A London court has ruled the arrest of 
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet by British police was illegal. 
The first members of a European mission responsible for verifying 
Yugoslav compliance with promises to end violence in Kosovo arrive 
in the Serbian province. And on "Dateline" economics correspondent 
Linda Cashtan examines the impact of the world economic downturn on 
Latin America. All in this hour of "VOA News Now." First a late summary 
of world news.
