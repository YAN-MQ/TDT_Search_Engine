The first members of the European mission responsible for verifying 
Yugoslav compliance with promises to end the violence in Kosovo have 
arrived in the Serbian province. The 13-member Norwegian team is the 
first of a 2,000-strong verification group being organized by the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Meanwhile, U.S.-Balkan 
envoy Richard Holbrooke says Serbia has made enormous concessions 
to help ease the crisis. But he says the final outcome depends on 
how Yugoslav authorities implement their commitments.
