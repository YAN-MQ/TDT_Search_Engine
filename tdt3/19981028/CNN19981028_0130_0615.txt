When it comes to the risk and care of heart disease, past studies 
have found a gender gap. Dr. Steve Salvatore reports on what the latest 
research is showing. Men and women are different when it comes to 
the kind of medical care they need and receive. This, according to 
several recent studies, and backed up by a just-released report. This 
new study points out the problem is not limited to the United States, 
it's global. It appears to be an experience certainly of countries, 
developed countries like the United States and England and France 
and Spain. According to a study in this week's "journal of the American 
medical association," women in Spain who suffer a first heart attack 
are at a 70% greater risk of death or readmission to the hospital 
than men. The question is why? The women indeed were older, they had 
a lot more associated diseases, heart attack was associated with diabetes 
and high blood pressure. They did not receive as aggressive treatment 
as the men did. In addition, women did not get the same follow-up 
treatment as men. They were less likely, particularly early on, to 
be referred for the balloon procedure to open up the arteries, or 
even for bypass surgery. Part of the problem is that many women don't 
realize they're at risk for heart disease. We must change our perception 
of heart attack. For years, heart attack has been thought of as a 
man's disease. Women get their heart attacks later, but the woman 
is vulnerable. Experts say women need to pay more attention to the 
risk factors, like smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure and high 
cholesterol, and realize that prevention is part of the cure. But 
the most important thing they need to do is ask questions. Dr. Steve 
Salvatore, CNN, New York.
