Dutch chemical group Akzo Nobel NV said Wednesday its third-quarter 
net profit fell 5 percent to 430 million guilders (dlrs 231 million), 
marred by financial crises in Asia, Russia and Latin America. The 
company reported a net profit of 455 million guilders (dlrs 244 million) 
a year ago for the same period ending Sept. 30. For the full year, 
the company expects a ``slightly higher full-year net income, excluding 
non-recurring items.'' Akzo shares fell sharply following the disappointing 
results. By midmorning its stock was trading down 8.4 percent. Akzo 
Deputy Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Fritz Frohlich said developments 
in Southeast Asia, Russia and Latin America and the strengthening 
of European currencies all had a negative impact on growth. He said 
the contribution from British chemical group Courtaulds PLC, which 
Akzo bought earlier this year for 6.1 billion guilders (dlrs 3.2 billion), 
was ``slightly negative.'' Akzo hinted that Courtaulds' integration 
and its withdrawal from the fibers business may lead to job losses.
