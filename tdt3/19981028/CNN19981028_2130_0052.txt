AIDS is increasingly becoming an epidemic of color. At a ceremony 
today, President Clinton announced an initiative to prevent the spread 
of the disease. African-Americans now account for half of new HIV 
infections. Blacks are eight times more likely than whites to contract 
the virus, hispanics, four times more likely. President Clinton says 
it will make information for available. This will allow expansion 
of education efforts, and to target specific communities. It will 
allow minority communities to expand treatment. It will inclus access 
to therapies. Because life saving therapies cannot be reserved only 
for the rich.
