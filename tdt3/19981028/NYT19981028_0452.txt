Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, has employed a team of outside 
investigators, all of them former federal agents, to supplement his 
staff during the course of his four-year investigation into President 
Clinton. With Democrats seeking to turn attention away from Clinton 
and onto the prosecutor, the hirings _ at a cost of thousands of dollars 
_ was questioned Wednesday by Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. ``He's got 
the whole FBI available to him,'' said Nadler, a member of the House 
Judiciary Committee, which is conducting the impeachment inquiry of 
Clinton. ``Why is he hiring private investigators? Why is he wasting 
the taxpayers' money?'' Federal law enforcement officials said that 
there is increasingly a struggle for resources among the Justice Department, 
the FBI and independent counsels. They said the FBI encourages the 
hiring of retired FBI and IRS agents for these investigations. The 
use of private investigators was just one glimpse into the almost 
$40 million Whitewater and Lewinsky investigation that was provided 
by routine audit reports on the expenses of the independent counsel's 
office conducted by the government's General Accounting Office. Nadler 
said he had requested copies of the audits because he is the ranking 
Democrat on the Judiciary subcommittee that will consider next year 
whether to extend the independent counsel law. The expense statements 
show that in January, shortly after Starr began investigating the 
president's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, his office envisioned 
that it would be in operation for at least three more years. On January 
26, it justified a decision to purchase a $56,810 copying machine 
instead of leasing one because ``we will have a need for this copier 
for at least 40 months.'' Starr is also paying top dollars for some 
of his legal advisers. Sam Dash, a Georgetown University professor 
who was chief counsel for the Senate Watergate committee, has been 
getting paid at a rate of $400 an hour to give ethics advice to the 
independent counsel's office. Ronald Rotunda, a University of Illinois 
law professor who advises Starr on constitutional law, gets $300 an 
hour. Starr's office also paid a $20,000 retainer to a group called 
Decision Analysis to study community attitudes in preparation for 
the prosecution of Jim Guy Tucker, the former governor of Arkansas. 
The private investigators hired by Starr are retired agents such as 
Jerry Bastin, a former FBI agent who was the losing Republican candidate 
for county sheriff in Madison County, Tenn., four years ago. Bastin 
was paid $62,360 by Starr's office through September 1997. He was 
paid another $52,507.72 through the first quarter of this year. Another 
contract investigator, Coy Copeland, who was involved in the Lewinsky 
investigation, similarly earned $51,976.96 in the six-month period 
ending last March. He previously had earned $93,520 from the independent 
counsel's office. One of Starr's deputies said that there was ``absolutely 
nothing nefarious'' about the use of the investigators. The lawyer, 
Jackie Bennett, said the former agents were retained because of a 
recurring staffing problem caused when agents of the FBI and IRS that 
are detailed to the independent counsel are returned to their agencies 
a few months later, just when they gain knowledge about a particular 
aspect of the inquiry. ``It solves the problem, an insidious problem, 
of people being transferred to us for a temporary period and then 
moving back to their agency,'' he said. Bennett said that once hired, 
the investigators fill the same role as federal agents and that the 
hiring of the retired agents was no different from the practice of 
many independent counsels' retention of private lawyers and other 
experts to assist in their inquiries. Aides to Starr also said the 
payments to Dash were made at his normal billing rates. The payments 
are capped so that they cannot exceed Starr's annual counsel salary 
of $118,400, the officials said. In their defense of Clinton, the 
Democrats have been trying to shift the spotlight away from the perjury 
accusations against him and to look at the tactics of Starr. Some 
Democrats have said they will subpoena Starr to testify at hearings 
when the Judiciary Committee considers impeachment next month. Others 
say they are uncertain about such a strategy for fear that Starr could 
steal the spotlight by presenting a compelling case and erase his 
negative image with the public.
