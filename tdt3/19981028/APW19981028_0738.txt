Israeli and the Palestinians on Wednesday accused each other of not 
keeping promises they made in their new peace agreement, raising concern 
that the land-for-security deal will not get started on time. Concerned 
about delays, the United States has been pressing the two sides to 
stick to the timetable. ``All sides must begin implementation next 
Monday night,'' said Larry Schwartz, the spokesman of the U.S. Embassy 
in Tel Aviv. As part of that effort, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week. Under the agreement, 
Israel withdraws from 13 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks in 
exchange for Palestinian steps to prevent attacks on Israelis. Netanyahu 
raised the possibility of a delay when he said he would not begin 
a troop withdrawal until the Palestinians have presented a work plan 
on security. Netanyahu said he would not convene his Cabinet to approve 
the agreement until the security plan was in place. The prime minister 
also said he would not begin a withdrawal without Cabinet backing. 
``It happens to be that the prime minister cannot put forward and 
cannot implement international treaties on his own,'' Netanyahu said. 
``It has to be approved by the Cabinet.'' Netanyahu's senior adviser, 
David Bar-Illan, said that unless that Palestinian security plan was 
presented to U.S. officials by Monday, ``it will be impossible to 
proceed.'' However, Mohammed Dahlan, the Palestinian security chief 
in the Gaza Strip, accused the Israelis of making up excuses to try 
and get out of implementing the agreement. ``Mr. Netanyahu is simply 
trying to create a problem,'' Dahlan told The Associated Press. ``He 
is trying to place obstacles in front of implementation of the agreement.'' 
Dahlan said the Palestinians were meeting their obligations and were 
outlining their security plan in talks with U.S. officials. An American,
