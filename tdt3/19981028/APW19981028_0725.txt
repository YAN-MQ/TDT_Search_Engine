A district attorney has asked Zagreb district court on Wednesday to 
launch a criminal investigation against political analyst Slaven Letica 
for slandering President Franjo Tudjman in an interview with a Slovene 
newspaper. The investigation might lead to an indictment. If charged 
and tried, Letica can get up to three years in prison. The case would 
be the second in independent Croatia, based on a new law on insulting 
top state officials, including the president. Letica told the Slovene 
weekly Mladina in September that Tudjman ``loves deviant types. He 
feels a certain attraction to ... criminals, paramilitary criminals, 
prostitutes. These people fascinate him, because they're bringing 
some fun into his boring, bureaucratic life.'' Letica also said Tudjman 
was responsible for the increased gap between the rich and poor in 
Croatia and for tolerating the use of intelligence services in his 
ruling party's internal struggles. Tudjman's critics repeatedly charge 
that he tolerated the activity of some crime suspects. They also accuse 
him of enriching himself and his associates, while the majority of 
Croats live in virtual poverty. Letica, a professor at the medical 
university and columnist of the independent weekly Globus, was Tudjman's 
adviser in 1991. He later became his harsh critic. The Zagreb district 
attorney's office said Letica ``gravely insulted'' Tudjman, the state-run 
news agency HINA reported. In the previous case, the editor-in-chief 
and a reporter of the independent weekly Feral Tribune were charged 
with slandering Tudjman. In a 1996 edition, reporter Marinko Culic 
scorned Tudjman's plan to bury the victims of the infamous World War 
II Jasenovac concentration camp alongside members of the Croat Nazi 
puppet state that ran the camp. He compared the move to Franco's attempts 
to unite Spain under totalitarian rule. The two were acquitted in 
September 1996, but the prosecutor appealed and they are going to 
be retried. Critics at home and abroad have said such trials are reminiscent 
of Communist repression of the media and are in fact an attempt by 
theauthoritarian government to silence critics and clamp down on independent 
media.
