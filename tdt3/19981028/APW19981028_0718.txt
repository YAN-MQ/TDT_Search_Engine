The International Olympic Committee has completed its inspection of 
potential Austrian, Italian and Slovenian sites for the 2006 Winter 
Games, receiving a somewhat timid evaluation of ``professional'' for 
the joint candidacy. ``I can only congratulate (you) on this professional 
candidacy,'' Chiharu Igaya, the chairman of the IOC delegation was 
quoted as saying Tuesday at the end of the panel's three-day visit 
to the region. Under the catchword ``Klagenfurt 2006,'' the southern 
Austrian province of Carinthia, Giulia Venezia in Italy and Slovenia 
have pooled efforts to compete for the Winter Olympics in eight years. 
The Austrian city of Innsbruck organized Winter Games in both 1964 
and 1976. Igaya said the task of the mission was not to make suggestions 
or voice criticism but to make a technical appraisal of the application 
on the basis of 18 themes established by the IOC. He said he would 
submit a report on his visit to be drafted after visiting all candidates 
by the end of January 1999. The 2006 Games wil be awarded on June 
19, 1999, in Seoul, South Korea. ``We have discovered a region which 
has very much to offer for the Winter Olympic Games,'' Igaya said 
according to the Austria Press Agency. He cited the great tradition 
of winter sports, the experience with big events, excellent infrastructure, 
the Olympic Village as well as the great support from authorities 
and the population. But he said it was a weakness that the individual 
sites are ``scattered somewhat far apart.'' Told by his hosts that 
this was also the case in Nagano, Japan, where Igaya was part of the 
organizing committee, Igaya replied, ``I hope these problems do not 
reappear once more.'' The evaluation commission was scheduled to travel 
on Wednesday from Klagenfurt, the Carinthia provincial capital, to 
Poprad, Slovakia. The last stop on of its tour is the joint candidacy 
of Helsinki and Lillehammer in Norway. Sion in Switzerland and Turin, 
Italy, already have been visited.
