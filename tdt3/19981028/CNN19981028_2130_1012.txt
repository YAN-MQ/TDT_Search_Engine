Many airlines are trying to make layovers more pleasant and more productive 
by updating their airport clubs. Kalin Thomas-Samuel has details in 
our "working ahead" report. They're supposed to be an exclusive benefit 
for frequent travelers. But with more and more Flyers joining airport 
clubs, they're becoming overcrowded and overused. So many airlines 
are renovating and expanding their clubs. The airlines simply have 
a lot more money right now. They made about $5 billion last year, 
and so they're taking some of those profits and plowing them back 
into an improved product. Most airlines started renovating their flagship 
clubs first -- like Delta's crown room, here in Atlanta. Delta surveyed 
its customers to help with the redesign. Passengers wanted more separation 
of the lounge and business center. Downstairs you have more of the 
leisure-type area. And then upstairs we have the area for them to 
conduct business. The downstairs lounge includes a bar and the reservations 
desk, while the business center has individual cubicles with phones 
and computer hookups, conference and vip rooms, an area for xeroxing, 
faxing, and shredding, and the all-important shoe shine stand. I think 
Atlanta has the best crown room of anywhere because of the computer 
hookups, okay, and the big desks. I spend a lot of time connecting 
flights here. It is much improved. And particularly since there is 
no more smoking allowed in the crown rooms. But the renovations come 
at a price. Starting January 1st, Delta will start charging for bar 
drinks. And as of September 1st, general membership for the crown 
room increased from $300 to $350. If that price is too much for you, 
a day pass is only $25. TWA and American are also remodeling their 
airport clubs. The travel industry expects to see more club renovations 
as airlines try to keep up with the competition. Kalin Thomas-Samuel,
