Security around Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was tightened Wednesday 
in response to calls by Jewish extremists to ``take down'' the leader 
following his agreement to hand West Bank land to the Palestinians. 
While visiting the Knesset, one of the most secure buildings in Israel, 
Netanyahu was surrounded by eight bodyguards Wednesday. In a front-page 
photo with the caption ``under tight guard,'' the daily Maariv showed 
Netanyahu accompanied by several guards. Netanyahu has said he was 
aware of the possible dangers, but that he tried to ignore them when 
making decisions. ``The minute leaders ... make their policies based 
on personal risk of any kind, they are completely immobilized,'' he 
told CNN earlier this week. The prime minister also said he felt that 
the Islamic militant group Hamas posed more of a threat to his safety 
than Jewish extremists. He said Hamas had put a price on his head. 
Israeli police began investigating two Jewish extremists, Noam Federman 
and Rabbi Moshe Levinger, on suspicion they incited to violence against 
the prime minister. Delivering a eulogy Tuesday for a Jewish settler 
killed by Palestinian militants in the West Bank town of Hebron, Federman 
held Netanyahu and his land-for-peace policy responsible. ``We need 
to take down a man like this,'' Federman told the mourners of Danny 
Vargas, a 29-year-old security guard from the Jewish settlement of 
Kiryat Arba near Hebron. As part of the new security arrangement, 
Netanyahu has been asked by the Shin Bet security service to stay 
away from large crowds, Israel radio said. From now on, Netanyahu 
will travel in helicopters when visiting the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
and a major road near his home may be closed to restrict access, the 
report said. Netanyahu's office would not comment on the security 
arrangements. Concern in Israel over renewed political violence grew 
after hundreds of Jewish settlers gathered outside Netanyahu's home 
on Monday evening, several hours after the slaying of Vargas. Some 
in the crowd chanted ``traitor, traitor.'' Demonstrators also held 
up a large drawing showing Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat shake bloodstained hands. The protests came as Israelis prepared 
for the third anniversary of the assassination of late Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin by a Jewish extremist. The assailant, Yigal Amir, said 
he killed the prime minister because he wanted to stop the handover 
of land.
