After long deploring political commercials that hit below the belt, 
a good-government group decided this fall to fight back, and not by 
Marquess of Queensberry rules. ``Are your candidates more concerned 
with attacking the issues or attacking each other?'' asked an off-screen 
voice in the group's 30-second commercial that appeared repeatedly 
last week on CNN. The advertisement, which is the work of the Annenberg 
Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, featured two 
middle-aged politicians turned ``boxers,'' hilariously out of shape 
and out of place in trunks and gloves. What they lacked in skills 
they made up for in dirty tricks: punches below the belt and a knee 
to the groin. The audience in the commercial reacted with shock and 
disbelief. Even the political consultants in the wings _ the type 
who brought Willie Horton commercials into the living room _ seem 
stunned. ``This is not what we're voting for,'' said an on-screen 
text. But after viewing the commercial a few times, a viewer is left 
with the inescapable impression that it is rather like those very 
advertisements it purports to condemn, a fact that is not lost on 
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg center. ``It's 
an attack ad against dirty campaigning,'' Jamieson said in a recent 
telephone interview. She said such spots had their place. Jamieson 
said it was impossible to gauge whether the commercial has had any 
effect on what candidates are putting on television as the election 
nears. At least, she said, it may raise voters' consciousness about 
the kind of political combat they are watching. Based on studies of 
races for governor, House and Senate in 30 states, Jamieson noted 
what political pundits and journalists have been saying in recent 
days: As October draws to a close, the number of pure attack advertisements 
is on the rise, outnumbering advocacy commercials, which make a case 
for the sponsor. But attacks ads still trail contrast spots, which 
make a case for the sponsor and against the opponent. The center's 
Washington director, Douglas Rivlin, is not naive enough to believe 
candidates will refrain from attack spots if they seem to be working. 
But he said he found them troubling because he thought they caused 
some people to stay home on Election Day. ``It's kind of embarrassing, 
frankly, to talk to Germans or Brits or others where the turnout is 
so much higher than ours,'' Rivlin said. ``It's always better when 
more people are deliberating, debating, casting their votes.'' Both 
Jamieson and Rivlin conceded that political spots do not always fit 
neatly into the pigeonholes of attack, advocacy or contrast. Jamieson 
said journalists often thought political advertisements were more 
negative than they actually were, then wrongly reported about an epidemic 
of ``negative campaigning.'' This week, the center has been running 
another commercial on CNN. Like the first, the new spot was financed 
by the Pew Charitable Trusts, a Philadelphia foundation that supports 
activities in public education and public policy. In the second commercial, 
each candidate is asked a question. One nods sagely, the other takes 
off his glasses and looks deeply thoughtful. Neither says a word. 
The message: What a candidate does not say is as important as what 
he does say.
