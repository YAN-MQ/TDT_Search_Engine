And I understand, Tom, you have more details on Mr. Glenn. Well, indeed. 
Of course, John Glenn, I think it's safe to say, is regarded by most 
people as being a genuine American hero. He was born back in 1921. 
Mr. Glenn served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1943 to `65 -- was 
a combat pilot in World War II and the Korean conflict. He rose to 
national prominence as a member of the original seven Mercury U.S. 
astronauts. And, on February 20, 1962, he rode a cramped one-man space 
capsule into history, circling the earth three times and splashing 
down safely at sea. The flight was a breakthrough for the fledgling 
U.S. space program running a Cold War race with the Soviet Union. 
After leaving the program, Mr. Glenn was elected to the Senate as 
a Democrat from Ohio in 1974 and re-elected three times.
