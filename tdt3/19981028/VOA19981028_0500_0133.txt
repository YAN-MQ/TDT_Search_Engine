Israeli media reports say Israel's secret service has increased security 
for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the wake of angry protests 
by opponents of the new peace accord. The reports say additional body 
guards have been assigned to Mr. Netanyahu, and security officials 
have advised him to appear less in public. Meanwhile, the United States 
says it is confident both Israel and the Palestinians will live up 
to their commitments under the new land for peace deal signed in Washington 
last week.
