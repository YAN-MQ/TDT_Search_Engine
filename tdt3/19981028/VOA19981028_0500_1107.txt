Rolling around to sports. Once again Steve Shy has got the story. 
Bruce Arena, the man who led major league soccer's D.C. United to 
two titles in three years, is the new head coach of the U.S. National 
soccer team. The U.S. Soccer Federation made it official at a news 
conference Tuesday in New York City, announcing Arena had signed a 
four-year contract. The 47-year-old Arena led D.C. United to the MLS 
Cup Championship in 1996 and 1997. On Sunday, the club lost this season's 
final to the Chicago Fire. Before coming to the nation's capital, 
Arena was head soccer coach at the University of Virginia, where he 
won five U.S. collegiate titles. He also coached the 1996 U.S. Olympic 
soccer team. Arena replaces Steve Sampson, who resigned in August 
after guiding the U.S. team to a last-place finish at this year's 
World Cup in France. Arena says there is a need to start with a new 
base of players for the U.S. National team. We will not rule out any 
players. All players are still eligible to be part of this team, the 
men's national team program. But we need to start building with young 
players. And I think MLS has a great pool of players, a great talent 
base. And, with proper experience, proper opportunities, I think we 
can be successful. Arena's national team debut will come November 
6, when the U.S.A. plays Australia in a friendly match in San Jose, 
California. U.S. soccer officials say Arena has already selected much 
of the team for that match, including young standouts like D.C. United 
midfielder Ben Olson, Chicago Fire forward Josh Wolf, and Fire goal 
keeper Zac Thworton.
