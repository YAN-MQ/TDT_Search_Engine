A music professor in Iowa says he's found some previously unknown 
music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. David Buesh, a professor at the 
University of Northern Iowa, says he found an obscure Viennese operate 
composed by Mozart -- at least that's what he says he found when he 
was researching operas of the eighteenth century. When he stumbled 
onto Mozart's name, it was on a lit of composers of a batch of sheet 
music that had been stored in Hanmark, Germany. Not everyone in the 
music world agrees with Professor Buesh's belief that he's found an 
undiscovered work by Mozart. But the Boston Baroch Orchestra has agreed 
to perform the composition, which is called "The Philosopher's." It 
probably hasn't been heard since the early 1800s. You know, Mozart 
died impoverished. Mm-hmm. The Country Music Association is trying 
to prevent that type of fate for many people in the industry today. 
They're teaming up with a record company to raise money for... ... 
Wait here. Wait here. ... a residence... ... Mozart was a country 
music star? No! Mozart was in poverty at the end of his life. And 
the Country Music Association is trying to help out these retired 
country musicians, you see,... Oh, I get -- I get it. I get it. I 
see. ... so they won't be in poverty. I get it! I get it! Are you 
with us? Are you with us? Barely. OK. That's the deal. Sony music 
has already donated $50,000 of anticipated profits from its recently 
released album, "Tribute to Tradition." I bee you that Mozart wished 
he'd had $50,000 at the end of his life. 50,000 pennies would have 
come in handy, sure. That's right. Exactly! It's got all kinds of 
famous artists in the country world today are on this album, but it'll 
be a while before they're able to finalize where they're going to 
build this home or anything like that. But they're working on that.
