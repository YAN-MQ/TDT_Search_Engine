What they really, really want is to be a spice girl for a day. Thousands 
of baby, scary, sporty, and posh wanna-bes auditioned to be in a Commercial 
for spice girl dolls and other merchandise. Some of the little spices 
had big attitudes. One scary spice imitator, told by a rival she looked

'scares-me' spice, I can sing. I can dance. I can act. We'll see what 
they say inside."
