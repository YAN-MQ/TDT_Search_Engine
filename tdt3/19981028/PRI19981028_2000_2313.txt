"What makes the desert beautiful is that somewhere it hides a well," 
so wrote Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the famous aviator, author, and 
most important, clue to today's Geography Quiz. Saint-Exupery was 
born in Lyon, France and was an aviator pioneer during World War I. 
His view of the Sahara, during one of those early flights, became 
the inspiration for his classic children's tale, "The Little Prince". 
We're looking for the place, it is rumored Saint-Exupery last flight 
went down. Saint-Exupery had fled German occupied France in 1940, 
and he'd signed on as an allied pilot. In 1944, while on a reconnaissance 
flight over southern France, his plane disappeared. Today it is reported 
a fisherman in this Mediterranean city pulled in his nets, and discovered 
what may have been Saint-Exupery's identity bracelet, packed in coral. 
Saint-Exupery remains and those of his plane may lie nearby. "There 
is no hope of joy except in human relations," said Saint-Exupery. 
Well, finding the answer to our Geo-Quiz might still give you a warm 
glow. So what is this famous French town, renowned for its bouillabaisse 
and now for its low-flying hero? Stay tuned, we'll let you know, toots-sweet.
