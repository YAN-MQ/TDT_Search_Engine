A renowned U.S. heart surgeon says he believes Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin will recover from his current illness and return to work in 
a few weeks. Dr. Michael D'Bachi, the cardiologist who advised Mr. 
Yeltsin's heart surgeons, says the Russian leader needs time to recover 
from bronchitis. Mr. Yeltsin is receiving medical treatment at a sanitarium 
outside Moscow to recover from what his doctors are calling extreme 
fatigue and erratic blood pressure.
