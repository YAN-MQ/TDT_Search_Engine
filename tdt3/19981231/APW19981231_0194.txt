The collection of capital gains taxes in November lowered Hong Kong's 
budget deficit to 35.56 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 4.36 
billion) for the first eight months of the fiscal year, the government 
said Thursday. The deficit had stood at 50.16 billion Hong Kong dollars 
(U.S. dlrs 6.43 billion) at the end of October. The Hong Kong government 
said it expects the deficit to keep shrinking as more taxes are collected 
before the fiscal year ends on March 31 _ but it was unclear whether 
the budget imbalance can fall far enough to meet the government's 
target. Officials are hoping to limit the full-year deficit to 21 
billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.69 billion). A statement said 
expenditure in the first eight months of the fiscal year came to 148.07 
billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 18.9 billion), while revenue 
totaled 112.51 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 14.42 billion). 
Hong Kong's fiscal reserves were 430.29 billion Hong Kong dollars 
(U.S. dlrs 55.17 billion), a decrease of 27.26 billion Hong Kong dollars 
(U.S. dlrs 3.49 billion) since the end of March. In the previous fiscal 
year, Hong Kong had an 80.9 billion Hong Kong dollar (dlrs 10.37 billion) 
surplus. The territory is running a deficit this year because of tax 
breaks and increased spending on programs intended to lift the economy 
out of recession.
