Eleven European Union countries, as I mentioned, are launching the 
single currency tomorrow, New Year's Day, but Britain is not one of 
them. Many Britons consider it a loss of national identity. VOA's 
Laurie Kassman took an unofficial sampling of opinions on this sensitive 
subject. Oxford Street is one of London's most popular shopping districts 
for Britons and tourists alike. Foreign travelers shrug their shoulders 
at the mention of the euro, but one British shopper sees a dark and 
sinister side to a single European currency. I think it's demonic 
because in the Bible it predicts the resurgence of the Roman Empire 
as a combination of nations which will gradually rise to take over 
the world. Most euro skeptics do not describe the euro in biblical 
proportions, but a majority of Britons responding to a recent survey 
still say they do not want any part of it. We want our own English 
money. We don't want European money. I don't want euro money, no. 
We're very patriotic here so that's it. We don't want it. For now, 
the euro is mainly a currency of paper transactions. Coins and bills 
will not appear for another three years, but many Britons worry already 
about the loss of fiscal sovereignty if Britain joins the euro as 
the Labor government wants. That is Laurie Kassman reporting from 
London. And that's your business news report.
