No matter how tortured or how beholden it was to those blasted computers, 
the Bowl Championship Series did its job. No. 1 Tennessee will play 
No. 2 Florida State for the national championship here on Monday night 
in the Fiesta Bowl. The other seven bowl games over the New Year's 
weekend are simply warm-up acts, except for one, the Dissent Bowl. 
Or, if you like, the Sugar Bowl. That's a matchup that dares to spit 
in the face of the computer age, and can undo the BCS' best-laid plans 
to crown an undisputed national champion. It goes like this: If Ohio 
State (10-1) rolls over Texas A&AMP;M (11-2) and Florida State squeaks 
by Tennessee in an ugly game, then the Associated Press poll could 
presumably crown the Buckeyes No. 1 as the best one-loss team. The 
coaches poll, however, has promised its national title to the winner 
of the Fiesta Bowl. Granted, it is a remote possibility, but Ohio 
State coach John Cooper likes the idea enough to keep it floating. 
``We're ranked third in the country, got a chance to finish second, 
maybe first,'' Cooper said. ``It all depends on how well we play and 
what happens to Tennessee and Florida State. I think it's a long shot. 
We would have to have an exceptional ball game, and Florida State 
would have to win a sloppy game.'' The last team that looked beyond 
the Aggies, however, had its season ruined. In the Big 12 championship 
game, Kansas State was leading by 15 points and was packing its bags 
for the Fiesta Bowl when Texas A&AMP;M came back to win in double 
overtime, 36-33. Neither the Aggies' coach, R.C. Slocum, nor his players 
have said much about Cooper's campaign to win a split poll. But they 
do resent the implication that a team with the 10th-ranked defense 
led by the Butkus award winner Dat Nguyen is not worthy of a BCS bowl 
and its $11 million payday. ``We beat some pretty good teams to get 
here,'' Slocum said. ``We think we deserve to be here, and now we 
want to show what we can do.'' The two other BCS bowls _ the Orange 
and the Rose _ also award their participants the big-money payout, 
but will have to settle for offering fans entertainment value this 
year while waiting their turn for the championship game to rotate 
their way. In the Orange, the Florida Gators (9-2) will be without 
their defensive coordinator, Bob Stoops, who recently took the head 
coaching job at Oklahoma, as well as defensive end Tim Beauchamp and 
cornerback Dock Pollard. Both were suspended this week for violating 
team rules. Coach Steve Spurrier concedes those aren't the ideal conditions 
for containing the high-scoring Syracuse Orangemen (8-3) and quarterback 
Donovan McNabb, who takes 8,389 passing yards, another 1,561 on the 
ground and 96 touchdowns into his final game. ``Donovan can avoid 
people,'' Spurrier said. ``He's a tremendous passer, too. So it's 
going to be a big challenge to keep him in the pocket and try to cover 
some guys and slow down their offense.'' In the Rose Bowl, it is Cade 
McNown of UCLA (10-1) and an offense that averaged 40.5 points and 
482 yards a game against a Wisconsin defense that allowed only 10 
points and 270 yards a game. The Badgers (10-1) have also been maligned 
for playing a soft schedule that did not include Ohio State or Michigan, 
but also posted two shutouts and gave up seven points or fewer in 
six games. ``We are not going to come out and pull any magic tricks 
or bunnies out of the hat,'' said Badger end Tom Burke, who leads 
the nation in sacks with 21. ``We are just going to come out and play 
fundamentally strong, as we have all year.'' The best of the rest 
of the opening acts are Notre Dame (9-2) against Georgia Tech (9-2) 
in the Gator Bowl, and Penn State (8-3) and Kentucky (7-4) in the 
Outback Bowl. Irish quarterback Jarious Jackson says he is fully recovered 
from a knee injury that kept him out of Notre Dame's final game against 
Southern California and five weeks of workouts. ``I'll do whatever 
they call; whatever they call, I'm going to run,'' he said, though 
it was unclear if he would start or how much he would play. ``I'm 
just looking forward to playing the game. If I get hit, I get hit.'' 
And the Nittany Lions, along with the rest of college football, will 
see the Heisman finalist Tim Couch for perhaps the final time. The 
junior will probably declare for the National Football League draft 
and may be its No. 1 choice _ the expansion Cleveland Browns hold 
it and are interested in the record-breaking passer. ``I just think 
everyone's excited about us,'' Couch said of the large Kentucky contingent 
that has descended on the Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla., area. ``Usually 
everyone's wrapped up in basketball in Kentucky this time of year.''
