Bell Atlantic Corp., the nation's largest local telephone company, 
is in talks to buy AirTouch Communications, the largest wireless phone 
company for $45 billion in stock, executives close to the companies 
said Thursday night. The deal, which could be announced as early as 
Monday, would bring New York-based Bell Atlantic, which already has 
5.7 million cellular customers in services blanketing the East Coast, 
one step closer to creating a nationwide and even international wireless 
network. AirTouch, which has 7.8 million customers in the United States 
and more than 11 million worldwide, serves the entire West Coast and 
has a number of partnerships in Europe and Asia that would expand 
Bell Atlantic's network considerably on those continents. Among those 
is a partnership with Mannesmann Mobilfunk of Germany that makes AirTouch 
one of the biggest providers of cellular services in Europe. In all, 
international wireless services make up 57 percent of AirTouch's operating 
income, according to Deutsche Bank Research. As with any deal not 
yet sealed, talks could fall apart at any time. But if the deal is 
approved, the purchase price would be about a 10 percent premium over 
AirTouch's Thursday closing price of $72.4375. Both boards are expected 
to meet over the weekend to discuss details. Any deal would also need 
the blessing of GTE executives. The company agreed last summer to 
be acquired by Bell Atlantic in a $52.9 billion stock swap. As of 
Thursday night, GTE executives were said to be supportive of the deal, 
believing it would be good for the combined companies. Bell Atlantic, 
one of the original ``Baby Bells'' spun off from AT&AMP;T, absorbed 
Nynex, the local phone company serving the New York and New England 
areas, in 1997. That deal was more a merger of equals that resulted 
in the former chairman of Nynex, Ivan G. Seidenberg, being named vice 
chairman and president of Bell Atlantic. Analysts said Thursday that 
if a deal was reached between the companies, the prices of some cellular 
calls, especially charges for roaming _ calls made when the user travels 
outside the area served by the provider _ could be sliced as much 
as 50 percent on the newly combined network, possibly enough to generate 
an industrywide reduction of rates. ``With all the increased competition 
in the industry, rates have been falling around 15 percent to 20 percent 
annually in wireless,'' said Mel Marten, an analyst with Edward Jones, 
an investment company. ``If this acquisition doesn't accelerate that 
amount, it should definitely keep it continuing.'' And beyond lower 
prices, analysts said that the main impetus for combining cellular 
networks was increasing consumer demand for convenience and simplified 
pricing _ the ongoing effort within the industry to offer service 
plans that can be used anywhere in the United States. Last year, AT&AMP;T 
introduced its Digital One Rate service, which lets users buy 600 
wireless minutes a month that can be used anywhere in the country 
for $90. Sprint PCS has introduced similar plans. A nationwide network 
forged in a Bell Atlantic and AirTouch combination, analysts said, 
would be well positioned to compete against both plans. Based on the 
closing stock price Thursday, Bell Atlantic has a market value of 
$83.8 billion, twice that of AirTouch, which is valued at $41.4 billion. 
``This deal makes all the sense in the world,'' said Charles A. Morris, 
manager of the T. Rowe Price Science and Technology Fund, which owns 
AirTouch stock. ``This allows them to have a national footprint and 
compete with AT&AMP;T and Sprint PCS.'' Still, any combination of 
the two companies faces hurdles among both regulators and investors. 
For one thing, the merger between GTE and Bell Atlantic, which is 
currently under scrutiny by the federal government, has not yet been 
completed. Adding another party to that merger could raise even more 
eyebrows in Washington, even though some industry observers suggest 
that a Bell Atlantic and AirTouch combination is likely to be completed 
first. And some investment analysts said Thursday that the deal could 
dilute Bell Atlantic's earnings, which in turn could have a negative 
impact on the share price of GTE stock. Investor reaction Thursday 
as rumors of an acquisition began to circulate on trading floors was 
predictable _ favoring the buyout target and pushing down the share 
prices of the buyer. AirTouch stock closed at $72.4375, up $3.0625, 
after flirting with a 52-week high of $75 per share earlier in the 
day. Bell Atlantic closed at $54 a share, down $3.50, while GTE's 
stock fell in tandem, dropping $3.375 to close at $65. In all, analysts 
said an AirTouch acquisition would be a coup for Bell Atlantic, giving 
it a 13 percent share of the wireless market and moving it ahead of 
AT&AMP;T, which has around 10 percent. More importantly, the deal 
would allow Bell Atlantic to have a nationwide wireless network similar 
to AT&AMP;T's system. Competition between the wireless companies has 
become intense in recent months, as several providers have rolled 
out new service plans to lure new subscribers. The changes come as 
a direct response to angry consumers, who grew tired of unpredictable 
monthly phone bills. One of the main factors that spiked the bills 
were roaming fees. In 1997, wireless customers racked up nearly $3 
billion in roaming charges, some 11 percent of the year's $27.5 billion 
in revenue.
