The government pinned a number Thursday to the weakening ruble, announcing 
that its value had dropped almost 70 percent over the last four months 
in relation to the U.S. dollar. And it announced that annual inflation, 
which appeared under control until the financial crisis hit in August, 
reached 84.4 percent in 1998. Russia is caught in the worst economic 
slide since the Soviet collapse seven years ago, sparked by the Asian 
financial crisis, falling world prices for oil _ Russia's biggest 
export earner _ and successive governments' chronic inability to finance 
expenditures. In 1998, the country's gross domestic product shrank 
5 percent and industrial production by 5.5 percent, the Economy Ministry 
said Thursday, according to the Interfax news agency. Foreign trade 
declined by 13.6 percent in the first 11 months of the year, and exports 
to countries outside the former Soviet Union dropped 17.6 percent 
from last year, reaching dlrs 57.7 billion, the ministry said. Imports 
dropped by a quarter in 1998, the State Customs Committee estimated. 
After the government of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko devalued the 
ruble in August, its value dropped from about 6 to the U.S. dollar 
to more than 20 to the dollar _ almost a 70 percent drop, the Economy 
Ministry said. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned government workers 
that their salaries would not be increased until the incomes of the 
country's poorest citizens began rising. ``I don't think ... it would 
be correct to raise salaries for ourselves without raising the salaries 
of the poorest citizens,'' Primakov said. ``We cannot turn Russia 
into an economically prosperous country in just a few months, but 
it's our duty to do as much as possible,'' he was quoted as saying 
by Interfax. Nearly one-third of Russia's 150 million people are living 
below the official poverty line, the government said recently. Meanwhile, 
a Russian court has declared bankrupt what was one of the country's 
largest banks, clearing the way for the first liquidation of a major 
bank since the crisis broke in August. The Moscow Arbitration Court 
ruled this week that Tokobank was bankrupt and that its assets should 
be distributed among creditors, The Moscow Times reported. The bank 
was once among the 20 largest in Russia, but now has debts of 7.5 
billion rubles (dlrs 363 million) and assets of just 3.4 billion rubles 
(dlrs 165 million), the newspaper reported. Many of Russia's approximately 
1,500 banks have been hard hit by the financial crisis and have either 
closed or are providing only limited services. In another development, 
the Central Bank said Russia's hard currency reserves stood at dlrs 
12.3 billion as of Dec. 25.
