Brush off you tux and haul out your best dress, because we're getting 
classy for today's geography quiz. We're looking for a Central European 
nation where classical composers rule. Music mavens from around the 
continent came here in the 18th and 19th Centuries and they were warmly 
received and funded by the ruling Hampsberg family. With their bills 
paid, these talented innovators were free to explore and develop symphonies, 
concertos, sonatas, and operettas, but when the clock strikes midnight 
tonight, this country will honor one of its one. The man the world 
knows as the waltz king. He was born in the country's capital and 
largest city where tomorrow's celebration will be especially swank. 
We'll have the name of this country and the Waltz King's most famous 
composition in 1, 2, 3 minutes.
