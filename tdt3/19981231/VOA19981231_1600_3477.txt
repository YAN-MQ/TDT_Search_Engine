American filmmaker and actor Woody Allen has spoken out in defense 
of President Bill Clinton. Allen told reporters in France that Mr. 
Clinton is being persecuted by the extreme right of American politics 
for having an affair with a consenting adult. Allen pointed out that 
first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, seems to accept that affair. In 
recent years, Allen has seen his own personal life enter the news 
headlines. Allen is now married to Soon Ye Previn, the adopted daughter 
of his former companion, actress Mia Farrow. Woody Allen says the 
Monica Lewinsky scandal has made the United States, in his words, 
the laughing stock of the world.
