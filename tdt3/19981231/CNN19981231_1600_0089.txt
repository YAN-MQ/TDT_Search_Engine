The weather contributed to a freeway pileup today in Michigan. It 
happened on interstate 75 near grayling, about 200 miles north of 
detroit. Dozens of cars crashed into one another on the ice-slickened 
roadway. Officials say two people were killed and at least five were 
injured, some seriously. Stranded motorists were bused to shelters. 
Police say strong winds and light snow created a whiteout. One official 
said, "it was like somebody pulled a curtain down." Stay tuned for 
the latest extended weather forecast at 8 minutes and 38 minutes past 
the hour.
