The U.S. ambassador to Israel ordered the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv 
closed Thursday after what embassy officials called a ``direct and 
credible'' threat of a terrorist attack against the building. U.S. 
officials said the threat was received Wednesday night, but they would 
not reveal its source or content, or how it was communicated. They 
denied Israeli radio reports that the threats were directed specifically 
against the ambassador, Edward Walker. It was the first time in memory 
that the U.S. Embassy in Israel had closed its doors for security 
reasons, officials said. ``This was a threatened attack against an 
American Embassy,'' said embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz. He said 
that while he could not confirm reports that the threatened action 
was a car bombing by opponents of American air strikes on Iraq, such 
a threat would be ``consistent'' with security measures undertaken 
by the embassy in response. ``We received a credible threat,'' Schwartz 
said. ``It was a direct threat. The ambassador, thinking it the prudent 
thing to do, decided to close the embassy for the day.'' Children 
and other dependents of U.S. Embassy and consular personnel in Israel 
were ordered out of the country by the State Department during the 
four-day bombing campaign against Iraq in December. The evacuation 
order has been lifted, but many families remain abroad. The embassy 
in Tel Aviv had planned to close early Thursday for the New Year's 
Eve holiday and is expected to reopen as scheduled Monday. The U.S. 
Embassy in Cairo was recently closed temporarily after receiving threats 
linked to United states action against Iraq, and Walker's action here 
Thursday should be seen in the same ``regional context,'' Schwartz 
said. The State Department has kept its foreign missions in a state 
of alert since the Aug. 7 car bombings of the embassies in Kenya and 
Tanzania killed 224 people and prompted air strikes against Sudan 
and the Afghanistan compound of the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, who 
the United States says organized the attacks. The security concerns 
increased in the Middle East as protesters throughout the Islamic 
world condemned December's military action against Iraq. On Dec. 24, 
the State Department said it ``continues to receive reports that make 
us concerned about the safety and security of both official U.S. government 
and civilian targets.'' ``We take these threats seriously and the 
U.S. has increased security at United States government facilities 
worldwide,'' the Department said. ``A number of our posts have temporarily 
suspended or limited services to the public, and may have to do so 
in the future.'' Though U.S. officials offered no details about the 
Tel Aviv threat, the fear of a serious terrorist attack against U.S. 
property and workers in Israel could in itself represent a disturbing 
change here. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas across the border 
in Lebanon and militant Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West 
Bank savage the United States with words, but confine their military 
actions and terror strikes to Israeli targets. U.S. officials in Israel 
say they doubt bin Laden has the capacity to mount terrorist operations 
in Israel, and it remains unclear who they believe to be the source 
of Wednesday's reported threat.
