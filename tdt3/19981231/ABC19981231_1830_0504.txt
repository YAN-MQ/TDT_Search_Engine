In Europe, they're celebrating more than the start of a new year. 
They're inaugurating a new common currency called the Euro. As ABC's 
Jim Wooten reports, it won't mean much to the change in people's pockets 
yet, but it's a big change nonetheless. No Euro coins or Euro bills, 
not yet, but a Euro launch nevertheless today as, in Brussels, eleven 
Le currency. Their old money, francs, Deutschmarks, lire and all the 
rest, will be good for another three years, but noncash transactions 
like travelers checks can be in euros now. Well, after midnight anyway. 
Stocks will be bought and sold in euros too, and the big trading firms 
were spending the holiday getting computers ready for Monday's markets. 
In Dublin, this broker's last deal in the currency of the old sod. 
I suppose it's the end of an era, really. I was here for the birth 
of the Irish pound and I suppose this is the end of it. The Euro will 
not be available for cash transaction until 2002, so Americans abroad 
won't be changing dollars into euros anytime soon. Still, many are 
pleased by the promise of simplification. Especially if you're hitting 
four countries. It gets crazy and you go back home with all that money 
and just say, "okay, now what do I do with it?" European bankers celebrated 
today -- uh, celebrated -- ah, celebrated their new money for the 
new year. Jim Wooten, ABC News, London.
