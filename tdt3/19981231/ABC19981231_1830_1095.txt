In the oil fields, the interior department has been checking to find 
"your money." It is supposed to come from royalties paid by companies 
to drill on public land. In may, we reported that Texas senator Kay 
Bailey Hutchinson got Congress to delay new rules requiring the oil 
companies to pay a larger share of their profits. Some in Congress 
were angry at Bailey's action. It shouldn't have happened, but it 
did. So now we have to correct it. But guess what? In October, Congress 
delayed the new rules again, until June. Loss to the treasury, about 
$5 million a month.
