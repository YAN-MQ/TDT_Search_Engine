The U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv was closed today while security officials 
investigate what they're calling "A direct and credible threat" against 
the facility. Officials did not describe the threat. But Israeli radio 
reports a caller told an embassy agent that the building would be 
blown up. The threat was received yesterday evening, and in response, 
employees were ordered not to report to work today. An embassy spokesman 
did not know how long the embassy would remain closed.
