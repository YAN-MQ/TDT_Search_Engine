In the nation's capital, the police are busy. Some say too many are 
busy protecting mayor Marion Barry. I'm a very controversial mayor. 
In a report back in March, we told you how the city council cut barry's 
controversial and costly 31-person security detail but still left 
him with 15 guards -- that's more than the vice president of the United 
States has on most days -- at a cost of $1.1 million. A new mayor 
takes over on Saturday. He says he wants to cut the detail even more.
