Capping a splurge of individual honors he has not known since his 
Heisman Trophy season of 1986, Vinny Testaverde Thursday got the one 
that means the most to him as a pro: his teammates voted him the Jets' 
most valuable player. The quarterback with the 12-1 record as a starter 
had never been named his team's most valuable player in a career that 
stretched to Tampa Bay, Cleveland and Baltimore. ``I tell you what, 
it feels pretty good to have your teammates vote for you,'' Testaverde 
said. ``It probably means more to me than any other award because 
it comes from your teammates.'' Testaverde is the first Jets quarterback 
since Ken O'Brien in 1985 to be voted the most valuable player. It 
came a day after he became the first Jet to be named one of six finalists 
in the Miller Lite Man of the Year Award, an official National Football 
League presentation, and was voted the American Conference's offensive 
player of the month a second straight time. A week ago he was named 
to the Pro Bowl. His newly found celebrity status was punctuated with 
an appearance Wednesday on ``Late Show With David Letterman.'' While 
Testaverde is not quite the court jester, he did amuse his teammates 
by bringing in a video Thursday of the tortilla chip commercial with 
Bill Parcells. ``It was our New Year's Eve celebration,'' wide receiver 
Wayne Chrebet said. Parcells, who had warned his players to avoid 
any late-night revelries, viewed the film briefly while players roared 
at their coach singing. Testaverde quietly has taken over as the leader 
of the offense with his remarkably solid play, calm demeanor under 
fire and occasional flashes of humor. Glenn Foley, whom Testaverde 
displaced as quarterback, remains the club's offensive captain _ a 
position he was voted to before the season began. Testaverde has presided 
over a pair of six-game winning streaks in setting a team-record 29 
touchdown passes. His passer rating, which is weighted heavily for 
touchdowns and interceptions, was second in the league to the Minnesota 
Vikings' Randall Cunningham. Other Jets who received honors from their 
teammates were: Bryan Cox, the Dennis Byrd Award for inspirational 
play; Pepper Johnson, the Ed Block Courage Award, and running back 
Leon Johnson, the Marty Lyons award for community service. Center 
Kevin Mawae was voted the Kyle Clifton Good Guy award by the Jets' 
staff.
