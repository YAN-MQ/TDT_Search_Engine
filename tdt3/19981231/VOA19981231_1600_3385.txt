This season, a new bowl coalition system was instituted to help create 
a true national championship game between the top two ranked teams. 
A wild finish has left number one ranked Tennessee with a bid to the 
Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Arizona. The volunteers will play the second 
ranked Florida State Seminoles for the 1998 national championship 
on January 4th. But the new college bowl coalition system failed to 
erase the controversy of the esoteric and complex bowl selection process 
of the past. Teams like fourth-ranked Kansas State were scattered 
among smaller, less prestigious bowls, while lower ranked teams such 
as number 17 Syracuse were destined to enjoy the spotlight of the 
top contests. Jim Stevenson, VOA sports.
