Governments and corporations the world over are busy tackling the 
year 2000 programming glitch. But did you know the bug could be lurking 
in your home? To show you where and help you debug, here's Kate snow 
with part three of our series. Even in your own home, tiny computers 
are hiding everywhere. Experts say the average household has about 
50 microprocessors that help you cook, clean and communicate. The 
good news is, most of them are immune to the millennium bug, they 
simply don't care what day or year it is. You don't need to worry 
about a regular stove or even a microwave oven, because even those 
have clocks in them, they generally don't have calendars in them. 
By and large, most of the systems in the home will work just fine. 
But some home electronics may encounter trouble in 2000, especially 
those that keep track of the date. One product that could be affected 
is your VCR. You might want to check it with a simple test. Program 
it to December 31st, 1999, just before midnight. Then wait five minutes 
and see what happens. If you see Saturday pop up on the screen, your 
VCR knows it's the year 2000. But if your VCR says Monday, it thinks 
it's 1900. If yours is one of the confused models, don't despair. 
There's a quick fix for the problem. On January 1st, 2000, set your 
VCR's clock back to 1972. That's right, 1972. Like 2000, '72 was a 
leap year that began on a Saturday. So all the dates and days of the 
week match up. In many homes, the most obvious place to look for the 
millennium bug is your personal computer. If you have a macintosh, 
or use windows '98, you should be okay. Windows 95 users may have 
some minor problems. If you have an older operating system, Ms-dos, 
for example -- which it's still around -- windows 3.1, are not Y2K 
compliant. They do not know about the year 2000. If you're concerned 
about your computer, VCR or other home electronics, many manufacturers 
have set up web sites that can help. And there are software programs 
designed to identify and fix Y2K problems. So while your home may 
not escape the bug completely, there are ways to squash it before 
it does any real damage. Kate snow, "Headline News."
