Libya ordered Thursday all foreign airlines to close their offices 
in the country, Egypt's official news agency reported. The government 
said the closure would last until the United States and Britain accepted 
that the World Court should settle the dispute arising from the indictment 
of two Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am airliner over the 
Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988, killing 270 people, the Middle 
East News Agency reported from the Libyan capital, Tripoli. The Hague-based 
International Court of Justice, known as the World Court, had ruled 
in February that it has the authority to settle the dispute. The United 
Sates and Britain rejected any intervention by the court, but later 
offered to try the two suspects in The Netherlands before a panel 
of Scottish judges. Airlines have been forbidden to fly to Libya since 
1992 under U.N. sanctions designed to force Tripoli to hand over the 
two suspects. However, foreign airline offices in Tripoli sell tickets 
for travelers leaving Libya by road who plan to take flights from 
neighboring countries. Libya initially accepted in principle the U.S.-British 
offer of a trial in The Netherlands, but has subsequently insisted 
that, if convicted, the suspects should serve their sentences in Libya. 
The Western plan is for the sentences to be served in Britain.
