U.S. and British aircraft flew patrols over northern and southern 
Iraq without incident Thursday, as Iraq vowed to keep on challenging 
the western action. Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said there 
will be no let up in what he called Iraq's battle against aggressors. 
Iraqi air defense has fired on allied patrols enforcing the no-fly 
zones twice this week drawing retaliation from U.S. war planes.
