The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Jan. 1: A bipartisan 
investigation in the House of Representatives has uncovered serious 
damage to American national security from two decades of inappropriate, 
careless and in some cases illegal nuclear and missile technology 
transfers to China. These findings constitute an urgent warning that 
American businesses and political leaders must deal more carefully 
with China, a country with great power ambitions and nuclear weapons. 
Chinese interests sometimes conflict with those of the United States. 
The White House and Congress should quickly declassify as much of 
the report as possible, so that vulnerable areas can be identified 
and corrective measures taken. The inquiry began last June after The 
Times reported that two American companies, Loral Space and Communications 
and Hughes Electronics Corp., may have improperly helped China fix 
problems in rocket design. The House committee confirmed Pentagon 
and State Department findings that this assistance not only helped 
the Chinese space industry, serving the business interests of Loral 
and Hughes, but may also have helped improve the reliability of China's 
missiles. House investigators further uncovered a Chinese effort to 
acquire American military technology extending over the Reagan, Bush 
and Clinton administrations. It included stealing weapons designs 
from American nuclear laboratories and obtaining sensitive computer, 
missile and satellite technologies. The committee also reviewed the 
activities of the daughter of a senior Chinese general who helped 
channel Chinese government payments to Democratic Party fund-raisers. 
But the larger question of possible links between political contributions 
and national security damage will be pursued by the Senate intelligence 
committee. Despite partisan skirmishing on other issues in Congress, 
the committee's Republican chairman, Christopher Cox, and its ranking 
Democrat, Norm Dicks, conducted a responsible inquiry on a crucially 
important subject. They deserve America's thanks and serious attention 
to their findings.
