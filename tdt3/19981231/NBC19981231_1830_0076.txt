Good evening on this new year's eve, 1998, where here in New York, 
and to the west with the time zones across the country, Americans 
will gather tonight to say farewell to another eventful year. It is 
already 1999 in Australia, where they ushered in the new with fireworks. 
In Moscow. The new year was welcomed tonight by crowds in red square, 
and you're looking live at the place regarded by many as the epicenter 
of the celebration -- New York's Times Square tonight, where an estimated 
500,000 people will watch the ball drop tonight, overseen by over 
5,000 police officers.
