In men's college basketball Wednesday night, the top ranked University 
of Connecticut scored an easy win over Villanova while Duke plastered 
UNC Greensboro. Richard Hamilton had 27 points for Yukon, as the Huskies 
defeated the Wildcats 100 to 76. Huskies coach, Jim Calhoun, says 
his team just insisted on winning. It's really how we feel about each 
other. We assisted on like 70 percent of our baskets, and it seemed 
like more to me. And we got people open in the fast break, and caused 
a lot of turnovers. I think at one point, both teams were shooting 
50 percent, but we were up by 18 because we had done a tremendous 
job of making sure that we hacked them both defensively and offensively, 
and that was our game plan. Meanwhile, Corey Magetti had 22 points 
and ten rebounds, as Duke crushed UNC Greensboro 104 to 58. Blue Devils 
coach Mike Shushefsky says Magetti will continue to be an asset for 
the Duke team. top notch player for us, and he's had a lot of playing 
time but he'll keep seeing that and more. And he's somebody who can 
really grow and our team can grow as a result of his growth. Elton 
Bran added 18 points and 12 rebounds for the Blue Devils.
