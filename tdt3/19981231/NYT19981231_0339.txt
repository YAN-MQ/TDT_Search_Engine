Owen Wells, financial adviser to the Maine philanthropist Elizabeth 
Noyce, had just returned from a trip to the Pacific Northwest, where 
he had visited the Pike Place Market in Seattle and the Granville 
Island Public Market in Vancouver, British Columbia. ``I said to Betty, 
`I think we ought to build a public market in Portland,''' Wells recalled. 
``She said that was a great idea.'' Mrs. Noyce, who had come into 
her millions through a divorce settlement from her husband, Robert 
Noyce, a co-inventor of the microchip, was not particularly concerned 
about cost. It was 1993, not long after she had responded to the closing 
of banks across Maine by blithely creating a new bank in downtown 
Portland, Maine Bank and Trust Co. If a public market would help further 
revitalize downtown, if it would create jobs for this city of 65,000, 
if it would help the farmers of her beloved state of Maine, then she 
was all for it. Mrs. Noyce, who lived in Bremen, died in September 
1996 at the age of 65. She had given away $75 million, primarily to 
Maine charities, including the Portland Museum of Art, the Maine Maritime 
Museum, the University of Maine and the Maine Medical Center. The 
Portland Public Market, nearly as long as a city block and about half 
as wide, opened last October. It is a soaring two-story structure 
of glass and timber built on land owned by Mrs. Noyce. ``We had a 
great fall,'' said Ted Spitzer, the market director. Spitzer was giving 
a tour of the market the day after Christmas, showing off the displays 
of poultry, beef and bison (the bison is raised in Waterford), fruits 
and vegetables, homemade pies and ice cream, and fish not just from 
Maine but from all over the world. The Portland market, with 23 vendors 
and more expected, is a tiny fraction of the size of the Pike Place 
Market, which has 250 businesses. But it does have the expertise of 
Walter Compare, who left his fish job at Pike Place to move back east 
with his wife, Holly, a Maine native. Compare was behind the counter 
at Hanson Brothers Seafood, where he had arranged a still life composed 
of mussels, eels, oysters, tuna and salmon. He does throw an occasional 
fish, he said, like the showmen at Pike Place, ``but we don't like 
to copy.'' At the other end of the market, the Port City Jazz group 
was serenading shoppers. People were grazing on generous free samples 
of smoked salmon, goat cheese and homemade jam and crackers. Emma 
Hayes, 6, and her sisters, Isabel, 4, and Eliza, almost 2, from Cumberland, 
were enjoying strawberry ice cream cones from Smiling Hill Farm with 
their mother, Betsy Hayes. At Borealis Breads, which was closed for 
the day, a hand-printed sign said the bakers were home with their 
families. Spitzer said the owner, Jim Amaral, had contracted with 
several Aroostook County farmers to grow wheat for his bread. This 
is exactly the market that Betty Noyce would have wanted, Wells said. 
``She would have admired the entrepreneurial ability of these people,'' 
he said. It cost $9.4 million to build the market, which operates 
seven days a week, year-round. ``She wanted it done right,'' said 
Wells, who is the president of Mrs. Noyce's philanthropic foundation, 
Libra. ``She said, `I don't want the market to become like Quincy 
Market where they sell T-shirts and knickknacks.' She wanted food.'' 
The market is next to Maine Bank and Trust, which now has 14 branches 
around the state, and a few blocks from Barbara Bush Children's Hospital, 
which Mrs. Noyce helped endow. None of Mrs. Noyce's projects bear 
her name. ``She never wanted any kind of memorial,'' Wells said. ``People 
wanted to name scholarship funds after her, and buildings, and she 
always said no.'' In the same spirit, she also refused honorary degrees. 
``She thought just giving money was not the appropriate measure for 
an honorary degree,'' Wells said. But on the second floor of the market 
is Wells' private tribute, a small sculpture of an old woman pushing 
a cart laden with vegetables, and feeding corn to a crow. The sculpture, 
by a Colorado artist named Nancy Roper, was originally titled ``Henrietta 
and the Heckler.'' Wells has renamed it ``Betty Sharing the Bounty.''
