While President Clinton was trying to warm relations with Moscow, 
Muscovites themselves were warming up to near record high temperatures. 
This comes a week after very cold weather killed a number of people 
in the Russian capital. But now the thermometer has come within one 
degree of an all-time high for late December. And as Eve Conan reports 
from the Russian capital, Muscovites are not amused. One look out 
the window and you will see it. Moscow is melting. Instead of fresh 
snow crunching underfoot, there is mud and more mud. A walk in the 
park is more like a stroll through a swamp. As Moscow effectively 
shuts down for the holidays, hopes for a White new year are fading 
fast. Sleds and skis are packed away in closets. Ice fishermen look 
grim. There is not a snowman in sight. One woman visiting Moscow's 
Pushkin Square on Tuesday, Tatiana Vladimirnova says the warm weather 
is miserable. She complains that Moscow's usual weather is better, 
a touch of frost. She says, "All this mush is not for me." She was 
visiting what should have been a lovely display of ice sculptures, 
a centuries old Russian tradition that transforms fairy tale characters 
into sparkling ice figures. But most of the beloved characters she 
had come to see were little more than puddles of their former selves. 
In one corner, what should have been a brave horsemen looked more 
like a headless horseman. Tuesday's temperature hit 2.4 degrees Celsius, 
more than nine degrees higher than the average for late December, 
which is minus seven. One man, Alexei Seenen says he finds all the 
warmth depressing. He says "It's nasty weather. It's humid. We need 
a frost of minus ten," he says, "and things will be fine. New Years 
must be frosty and snowy. This is very bad." But Muscovites can take 
heart. The weather forecast says nighttime temperatures by New Year's 
morning will drop to minus 13. There is hope yet. Eve Conan for VOA 
News, Moscow.
