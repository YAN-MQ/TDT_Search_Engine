Keith Van Horn called for a shift in the union's stance Thursday, 
saying that Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, and his 
19-member negotiating committee should let the league's 400-plus players 
vote on the owners' latest proposal. Van Horn, an unlikely dissident 
because his agent is David Falk, became the third player to publicly 
challenge Hunter's decision to let the fate of the union rest solely 
in the hands of the 19 players on the negotiating committee. The Nets 
forward said the only way to get a read on the sentiments of the union 
membership was to put what the league termed its final offer on a 
ballot. ``I definitely think we should have a vote,'' said Van Horn, 
who followed Kevin Willis and his Nets teammate Jayson Williams in 
requesting such a measure. ``Even though you have 19 guys representing 
the players, it may not necessarily be accurate or representative 
of how the other guys feel. And if 65 to 70 percent of the players 
want to play and feel that the deal is satisfactory, you have to take 
that into consideration.'' Van Horn's statement is surprising because 
the National Basketball Association Commissioner David Stern and many 
others believe that Falk has been manipulating the negotiating committee 
through his clients Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning. And Williams, 
who called for a secret ballot on Tuesday only to be rebuffed viciously 
by Ewing the next day, said he was kept off the negotiating committee 
because he was not represented by Falk. Hunter remains steadfast in 
not putting the offer to a vote by saying that nearly 250 players 
empowered the negotiating committee to do its bidding at an October 
meeting in Las Vegas, Nev. But with Stern's deadline of Jan. 7 just 
days away, Van Horn said that should be irrelevant. ``I think we're 
at a juncture now where we need to take all of the necessary action 
that we can to get this thing done,'' said Van Horn, who attended 
the mass union meetings in Las Vegas and New York. ``I think most 
players want to vote. ``I think a vote would be close,'' he added. 
While Van Horn's words may signify that Stern's strategy of twice 
mailing the owners' proposals directly to the players is beginning 
to crack the previously impenetrable solidarity of the union, Van 
Horn said they should not be taken as a full endorsement of the owners' 
proposal. ``If there was a vote, I really couldn't tell you which 
way I would go right now,'' he said. ``But the owners' proposal is 
pretty good. This is actually the first proposal that I've seen that 
I think is acceptable. I think it is as close to a fair deal as we're 
going to get.''
