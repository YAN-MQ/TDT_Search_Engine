They are supposed to go to the poor, to fight hunger, but food stamps 
have become an easy target for scammers. Just how easy? Back in April, 
we told you the government loses $1.5 billion to food stamp fraud 
and mismanagement every year -- to black market scammers who pay 50 
cents on the dollar, then redeem the stamps at full value from the 
government. To prison inmates, who have them delivered to their former 
homes. And, incredibly, to more than 26,000 dead people, whose survivors 
still reap the benefits of this widespread "fleecing." Since our report, 
Congress has ordered federal agencies to share updated information 
so the checks will stop going to the dead.
