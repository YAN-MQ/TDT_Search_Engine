When we come back -- fireworks and fizzy drinks. 1999 is already here 
for some. Gosh, you know, I just went to use the phone. And you say 
once you got back your wife was gone? Yes, sir. Hello! What? Have 
you checked the hot enchilada? oh, no! Millicent gets terrible heartburn. 
Not this time. What's that? Looks like the remains of an individually 
wrapped pepcid ac chewable. Introducing pepcid ac chewables. The first 
chewable to stop heartburn before it starts. Millicent, is that you? 
Start living heartburn free with new pepcid ac chewables.
