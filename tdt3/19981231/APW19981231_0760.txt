The U.S. government approved the first in a long-awaited new type 
of painkiller for millions of arthritis sufferers Thursday, but cautioned 
that its stomach-safe benefits may have been overhyped. Celebrex is 
the first in a new class of painkillers called ``cox-2 inhibitors'' 
that promise to cause fewer stomach-plaguing side effects than many 
of today's pain relievers. Wall Street analysts have trumpeted the 
drug as potentially the next blockbuster seller. But the Food and 
Drug Administration dealt manufacturer G.D. Searle a blow Thursday: 
While it approved the sale of Celebrex as a good option to relieve 
arthritis pain, the FDA declared there is not proof that the new drug 
ultimately is easier on patients' stomachs than older competitors. 
``The final answer is not in on the major question here: Is this safer?'' 
said FDA drug chief Dr. Murray Lumpkin. ``I'm disappointed at the 
FDA's stand on this,'' said Dr. Joseph Markenson of Cornell Medical 
College, who helped Searle test Celebrex and said the emerging data 
indicates it will cause fewer ulcers than competing drugs. With the 
FDA's warning, how many arthritis patients will try Celebrex _ and 
should they switch from older painkillers to the new drug? Arthritis 
patients with current stomach problems might consider Celebrex, Georgetown 
University rheumatologist Dr. Stephen Ray Mitchell said. But for those 
doing OK on older medicines, ``I would absolutely not change them 
right now'' to Celebrex, he said. Searle said Celebrex would be available 
by prescription within six weeks. Millions of people now depend on 
aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and a host of other pills called ``non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs,'' or NSAIDs. They are used by the 19 million 
sufferers of arthritis in the United States. They're also used to 
relieve everyday aches, recovery from surgery and myriad other pains. 
But NSAIDs can cause ulcers, stomach bleeding and other gastrointestinal 
side effects, especially in long-term users. NSAIDs are blamed for 
causing 107,000 Americans to be hospitalized every year, and for killing 
16,500. In 1990, scientists discovered the reason. NSAIDs target an 
enzyme called cyclo-oxegenase that is responsible for much inflammation 
accompanying pain. But it turned out there are two types of this enzyme. 
Cox-2 was behind the inflammation, while cox-1 actually protects the 
stomach lining. Unfortunately, NSAIDs hit both. The theory was that 
if scientists could develop a more specific drug that targeted just 
cox-2, it would alleviate pain and inflammation but not hurt the stomach. 
Half a dozen companies began racing to develop a better NSAID. The 
FDA on Thursday decided Searle's Celebrex, known chemically as celecoxib, 
could help relieve arthritis pain about as well as prescription-strength 
NSAIDs. Is Celebrex safer? Searle gave 4,700 patients endoscopies 
_ snaking a tube into their stomachs to see if ulcers were forming 
even before patients experienced symptoms. Patients taking Celebrex 
showed fewer of these mini-ulcers than patients taking prescription-strength 
ibuprofen or naproxen. However, mini-ulcers often heal on their own, 
so the big question is whether long-time Celebrex users ultimately 
suffer fewer painful ulcers and other serious side effects, the FDA 
said. Patients who try Celebrex should promptly report any gastrointestinal 
side effects to their doctors, the FDA said.
