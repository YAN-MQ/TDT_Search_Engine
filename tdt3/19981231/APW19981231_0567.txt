There will be no letup in Baghdad's ``battle against aggression,'' 
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said in remarks published Thursday. 
Aziz's comments came a day after the latest clash between U.S. warplanes 
and Iraqi air-defense units in the no-fly zones over Iraq. ``The battle 
against the aggression and aggressors has not stopped. It will continue,'' 
Aziz said in a front-page commentary in Al-Thawra, which is published 
by the ruling Baath Party. He did not specifically mention the no-fly 
zones. Aziz also criticized the decision by the Arab League to put 
off a meeting of foreign ministers. They had been scheduled to meet 
this week on the mid-December airstrikes by the United States and 
Britain against Iraq. But the session was put off until Jan. 24, after 
the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, at the request of Gulf states, 
especially Saudi Arabia. Aziz accused Arab League Secretary-General 
Esmat Abdel-Meguid of yielding to pressure from Saudi Arabia, terming 
it ``outrageous.'' ``The decision of the secretary-general lacks legitimacy 
... it also lacks fairness,'' Aziz added. Iraq had hoped for Arab 
League backing for its demand to lift U.N. economic sanctions imposed 
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions cannot be lifted 
until U.N. arms inspectors declare Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction. 
The U.S.-British airstrikes came after the inspectors reported Iraq 
was refusing to cooperate in the search for prohibited weapons. The 
no-fly zones were set up to protect Kurds in Iraq's north and Shiite 
Muslims in the south who rose up against President Saddam Hussein's 
government after the 1991 Gulf War. Saddam's forces quickly put down 
the revolts. The Pentagon said that in the latest clash U.S. jets 
launched missiles at an Iraqi anti-aircraft battery after it fired 
on British patrol planes. Iraq said one farmer was killed and two 
other civilians were wounded. It made no mention of military casualties. 
Two days earlier, U.S. jets fired on an Iraqi post in the northern 
no-fly zone. Iraq said that four soldiers were killed and seven wounded. 
Aziz also accused Abdel-Meguid of acting against the wishes of the 
Arabs, who he said resented their leaders' muted reaction to the bombing 
of Iraq. It was a reference to anti-American demonstrations around 
the Arab world during the airstrikes. He said Iraq's resistance to 
the United States and Britain would trigger ``further interest and 
wrath from the Arab masses'' and garner support for Iraq's campaign 
to get punishing U.N. trade sanctions removed. The newspapers also 
published more defiant remarks by Gen. Ali Hassan al-Majid, commander 
of the southern region. ``We shall continue (efforts) to liberate 
the skies of Iraq from devils who are supported by the biggest adulterer 
in the world ... who is aided by some evil Arabs, among them the rulers 
of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia,'' the official Al-Iraq newspaper quoted 
al-Majid as saying in a telegram to Saddam.
