In U.S. college football, sixth ranked Arizona has won the Holiday 
Bowl by defeating number 16 Nebraska 23 to 20. The victory in San 
Diego, California completes the best season in Arizona football history 
with 12 wins and one loss. Nebraska finishes the year with nine wins, 
but for the first time in 30 years, the Corn Huskers have lost four 
times in a single season. The Wildcats were hoping to go to the Rose 
Bowl as pack ten conference champion but lost that chance late in 
the season. Earlier Wednesday, the Idaho vandals scored a 42 to 35 
upset win over Southern Mississippi in the Humanitarian Bowl played 
in Boise, Idaho. Quarterback John Welch tossed his fourth touchdown 
strike with less than five minutes remaining to win that contest. 
Southern Mississippi erased a 14 points deficit to tie the game in 
the fourth quarter but Idaho stormed back needing just four plays 
to cover the length of the field to pull out the upset.
