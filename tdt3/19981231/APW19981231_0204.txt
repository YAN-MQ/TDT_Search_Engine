Two of the four surviving infants from China's first naturally conceived 
set of sextuplets have been experiencing breathing difficulties, a 
hospital official said Thursday. All four lost some weight after their 
birth on Dec. 23, but the three boys regained all they lost. The only 
surviving girl remained in the most delicate condition and occasionally 
had stopped breathing, said the director of the Newborn Research Section 
at the No. 2 Hospital at China Medical University, in the northeastern 
city of Shenyang. The babies remained in critical condition, said 
the official, who gave only his surname, Xue. The two smallest babies, 
a boy and a girl, died last weekend of lung hemorrhages. The mother, 
Yao Hong, hadn't used fertility drugs, making her babies the first 
naturally conceived sextuplets in China. Chinese media reports cited 
experts saying the likelihood of a woman giving birth naturally to 
sextuplets was one in 400 billion. A report Thursday in the newspaper 
Health Daily said that the three largest baby boys were a set of identical 
triplets. The three smaller babies _ two girls and a boy, were from 
separate embryos, it said. The babies were delivered by Caesarian 
section when Yao, then 28 weeks pregnant, experienced delivery problems. 
The largest weighed 2 1/2 pounds. Earlier this month in Houston, a 
woman gave birth to octuplets, one of which died of heart and lung 
complications. A Japanese woman gave birth to quintuplets in November. 
Both mothers had used fertility drugs.
