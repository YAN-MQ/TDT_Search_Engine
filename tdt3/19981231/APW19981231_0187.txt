A day after firing its naval chief, the Indian government on Thursday 
installed a new chief of the air force. The retirement of the air 
force commander left just one of the three service chiefs in place. 
The defense secretary, the senior civil servant in the defense ministry, 
also was shifted from his post in Wednesday's shakeup. Air Chief Marshal 
Anil Yashwant Tipnis took over as the new Chief of Air Staff from 
S.K. Sareen, who retired on schedule after a three- year term.
