Some of our FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take a short 
two-minute break. You're listening to VOA News Now broadcasting from 
Washington. Happy New Year's Eve. New Year's Eve it is in most of 
the world. Some areas approaching the bewitching hour of midnight. 
If you're in one of those areas, we hope you have a happy and safe 
New Year's Day. And if you happen to be drinking some holiday cheer, 
be careful when you drive home. This is Thursday, December 31st, the 
last day of 1998. On this date in 1943 - that was 55 years ago - enthusiastic 
fans in New York City caused a near riot when 28-year-old Frank Sinatra 
sang at the Paramount Theater which was considered to be the ultimate 
venue for popular singers during the World War II era. Sinatra had 
become a solo act in 1942. He'd been singing with the bands of Harry 
James and Tommy Dorsey. The reaction to Sinatra's solo appearance 
at the Paramount made it clear just how popular he was. Now his fans 
turned out in such great numbers that an additional 400 police were 
called in to prevent a riot. It's said that Sinatra's publicist decided 
to seek teenage girls from the theater's front rows so more people, 
including the news media, would witness the girls' enthusiastic screaming 
for the young singer. Many of these ardent fans were known as bobby 
socksers for the style in which they wore their white socks. Frank 
Sinatra, "Old Blue Eye," died of a heart ailment in May of 1998 at 
the age of 82. For much of his life, he was one of the most celebrated 
entertainers in America. Ten hours 30 universal time. This is VOA 
News Now. U.S. war planes have attacked a second Iraqi missile site 
after British aircraft were fired upon in the no-fly zone. Western

Those stories, business news, and the 1998 roundup on rhythm and blues 
and rap music all coming up in this half hour of VOA News Now. Hello, 
again, everyone from Washington. I'm Paul Westpheling. It is 10 hours
