Under intense pressure to reduce its spending, the Brazilian government 
has slashed funds toward a $250 million pilot project backed by seven 
leading industrial nations that has been the centerpiece of Brazil's 
efforts to save the Amazon rain forest. Environmentalists warn that 
without Brazil's participation, the project stands to lose almost 
all the donations yet to come from the Group of Seven industrial nations. 
Under the main agreement, approved at the 1992 Earth Summit here, 
Brazil was to provide just 10 percent of the $250 million. The pilot 
program pays for surveying the rain forest, and it has been the principal 
vehicle for marking off 40,000 square miles for indigenous reservations. 
Surveying what is in the vast mysterious rain forest is seen as the 
first step toward protecting it from destruction by ranchers, loggers, 
farmers and miners. The Group of Seven money was also earmarked for 
promoting sustainable development, controlling deforestation and other 
objectives. In addition, the money also would have helped pay for 
setting aside 10 percent of the rain forest, or 240,000 square miles, 
as national parks and ecologically protected areas. Amid much fanfare, 
Brazil's president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, had pledged to establish 
the protected areas during a visit to New York last April. Covering 
an area half as big as the continental United States, the Amazon is 
a lush laboratory of plants, animals and bacteria that contains more 
than 20 percent of the world's fresh water supply. Throughout much 
of the decade, as other countries criticized Brazil for failing to 
protect the rain forest, the government insisted that wealthy nations 
pay to map the rain forest and to protect its resources, and it frequently 
contended that the scale of the program agreed to was insufficient 
to the task. But environmentalists say that even that modest effort 
is now in jeopardy. Under pressure to rein in its budget deficit, 
Brazilian government officials have slashed spending across the board. 
A recent agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which is 
spearheading a $41.3 billion standby loan for Brazil, reduces government 
spending on environmental programs by two-thirds. Under the pilot 
program, the Brazilian government provides matching funds and manpower 
to administer the Group of Seven grant. The government's revised budget, 
released in November, cuts the amount Brazil can expect to get from 
the group to $6.4 million from more than $61 million. ``It is arguably 
a far more irrational and perverse consequence of the IMF agreement 
than even the harshest critics of the IMF could have imagined,'' said 
Stephan Schwartzman, a senior scientist at the Washington-based Environmental 
Defense Fund. The state of Acre, in western Brazil, one of the nine 
states covered by the rain forest, had developed a three-year program 
counting on some $5 million of the Group of Seven funds to survey 
and zone its forest. Ninety percent of the cost would have been underwritten 
by the group. ``When it was all under way and ready to move forward 
_ boom _ the cuts came,'' said Maria Janet Santos, who is coordinating 
zoning for Acre's environmental protection agency. ``It really cuts 
into the credibility of what we're trying to do.'' Paulo de Oliveira 
Lopes, who also works on the zoning project, said that without the 
Brazilian government contribution, the project would collapse. ``Without 
the resources of the G-7 to carry out zoning, there's no way it can 
happen,'' he said. Congress is expected to vote on the budget by Jan. 
15, and Sen. Marina Silva of the opposition Workers' Party said the 
government had not ruled out restoring the environmental funds if 
cuts could be found elsewhere.
