Leaders of the U.S. Senate are considering a plan which would avoid 
a full trial of President Clinton and censure him instead. The leadership 
is reported to be considering calling a vote early in the process 
on whether the charges against the president are serious enough to 
result in his removal from office. If the decision is yes, the trial 
would proceed. If the senators decide the charges are not worthy, 
they would move to a debate on censure. Some senators in contrast 
believe the Senate is required to proceed with the trial whether its 
members want to or not. The House of Representatives impeached President 
Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice ten days 
ago.
