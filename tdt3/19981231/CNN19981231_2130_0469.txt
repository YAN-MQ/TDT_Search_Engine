Federal and state governments appear to be doing a much better job 
of collecting delinquent child support payments. A department of health 
and human services report says $14.4 billion was collected in 1998. 
That represents an 80% increase since 1992. Federal seizures of income 
tax refunds helped contribute to the increase. The White House has 
announced it wants to create federal laws to restrict people from 
crossing state lines to avoid child support payments.
