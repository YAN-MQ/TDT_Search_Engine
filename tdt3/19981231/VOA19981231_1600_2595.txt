In a recent television interview, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright was asked about the child death toll in Iraq. She responded 
that the choices before the international community are hard and said 
Saddam Hussein is the one who's responsible for the tragedy of his 
people. Another specialist on the effects of sanctions on Iraq's children 
agrees with Dennis Halladay about the seriousness of the humanitarian 
problem. But Richard Garfield, an epidemiologist at Columbia University 
in New York, does not agree with those who say lifting sanctions is 
the answer. There's a need to respond to the tremendous human rights 
violations the Iraqi government has created. The appropriate response 
is not to create other massive violations of human rights of Iraqi 
civilians. I don't think two wrongs - getting rid of the embargo all 
together - will make the right of solving the problems. But there 
has to be a much more nuanced view and room for carrots and sticks 
in order to negotiate solutions to the political problems and more 
effective approaches to the humanitarian problems that have been created 
by sanctions. Richard Garfield, an epidemiologist at Columbia University 
in New York City. Iraq's children was the subject of today's Dateline.
