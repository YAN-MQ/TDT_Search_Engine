France's finance minister said Thursday that European Central Bank 
chief Wim Duisenberg should honor a commitment to step down after 
four years to make way for the candidate France had backed for the 
post. Duisenberg, in an interview published Wednesday by the newspaper 
Le Monde, said he will not step down after completing half his term. 
France had secured a verbal agreement that he was to be replaced by 
Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet. Speaking at a news conference 
on the eve of the new euro currency, French Finance Minister Dominique 
Strauss-Kahn said Duisenberg's remarks were ``not in accordance with 
commitments'' he made when approved for the job. ``I refer you to 
the formal declaration made by Mr Duisenberg last May and I have no 
reason to think things will be any different,'' Strauss-Kahn said. 
The new European Central Bank will govern the policies of the euro, 
the new single currency which goes into effect Jan. 1. France surprised 
its euro partners by proposing Trichet at the last minute for the 
job Duisenberg was expected to secure easily. Duisenberg agreed to 
step down after four years, but has since said no such ``gentleman's 
agreement'' exists. Trichet, in a television interview Thursday evening, 
said that ``a decision has been taken by the heads of state and government.'' 
President Jacques Chirac's Elysee Palace said Thursday it would not 
comment on Duisenberg's remarks. The newspaper Le Figaro was more 
forthcoming: ``New Europe strikes its first bad note,'' said its front 
page headline.
