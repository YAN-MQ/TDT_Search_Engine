Topsail island, North Carolina, in late August -- hurricane Bonnie 
becomes the third storm to sweep through the tiny beach community 
in the past two years. The community rebuilds again, and the federal 
government pays out again, an estimated $2.5 million dollars this 
time, on a piece of land that experts say should never have been developed 
for human habitation in the first place. Hurricane season starts again 
June 1st.
