But who knows what will save the U.S. treasury from the international 
space station? Liftoff of the space shuttle. The first American element 
went aloft this month. In March, we reported NASA tried to hide $6 
billion in budget overruns from congress. Space station on schedule? 
Ah, it's behind schedule. Is it on budget? It's over budget. Now, 
NASA puts the station's total cost at $30 billion. The original estimate 
years ago was $8 billion. That $22 billion overrun? "It's your money."
