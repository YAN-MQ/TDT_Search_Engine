A Massachusetts trial court judge has dismissed a Wellesley professor's 
libel suit against a student journalist who had written, incorrectly, 
that the professor ``gained tenure within the Africana Studies department 
only after successfully suing the college for racial discrimination.'' 
The professor, Tony Martin, sued Wellesley for racial discrimination 
in 1987, and the lawsuit was settled out of court. But Martin had 
been granted tenure in 1975. The student journalist, Avik Roy, writing 
in a student publication called Counterpoint, had included the incorrect 
information in a long article about various controversies involving 
Martin, and about the Wellesley administration's reluctance to have 
these controversies publicized. In the decision, Justice Judith Fabricant, 
a justice of Massachusetts state Superior Court wrote, ``There is 
simply nothing in the statement that a reasonable reader could interpret 
in a manner that would damage Martin's reputation among any respectable 
segment of the community.'' The judge said Martin did not prove defamation 
or malice. The Dec. 23 ruling was mailed to Roy's lawyer, Robert A. 
Bertsche, who made the ruling public Thursday. Roy's article was published 
in the journal _ a joint publication of students at Wellesley and 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology _ in 1993, when he was an 
MIT student. A year before the publication of Roy's article, Martin 
had drawn widespread criticism for using the book ``The Secret Relationship 
Between Blacks and Jews,'' which was published by the Nation of Islam, 
as a text in his courses. Roy's lawyer, Bertsche, said, ``The same 
First Amendment values that protect his right to teach that book protect 
the right of a student journalist to do reporting about him and give 
that student breathing room to have honest mistakes.'' Martin said 
that he would not decide whether to appeal until he had a chance to 
consult with his lawyer.
