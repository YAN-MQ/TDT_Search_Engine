Jewelry can evoke a sense of time and place. And for one designer, 
that means springtime at the beach. Elsa Klensch shows us a collection 
inspired by the seashore. Cool blue-green water, white-crested waves, 
champagne beaches and sun-bleached driftwood. This spring and summer 
'99 dweck is in his element. He combines his loves to sculpt jewelry 
with mystery, whimsy and contradiction. I love color. As a trained 
painter, I love to dabble with the minerals like if they were almost 
my ingredients, my materials, and do things with jewelry that are 
just timeless. So, when I play with, or when I want to focus on blues, 
powder blues, I'll have the most incredible chalcedonies with blue 
pearl, with every type gray, ethereal color there is to combine with 
one another. Then there is the incredible turquoises. There's Tibetan 
turquoise, Mexican turquoise. It's a collection of turquoises that 
just is enhanced with neutrals and deep tones of spice. And every 
interesting element that could work with turquoise. It's extremely 
colorful. I love chain. They're almost mechanical looking, as if almost 
it came from, as almost it's inspired from the machine age, where 
things were very industrial but at the same time very sleek. And, 
to me, very wearable. Now, in the sea group, iridescence is important. 
There's a lot of different ways in appreciating a pearl. But I look 
more to a piece of pearl or something from the sea that has an array 
of color. There's a lot of whimsy. I revisited from all the years 
of me creating different settings, the starfish. And I've always played 
with the starfish. And then there's the sea urchin, there's everything 
that could harmonize with the ocean. And in the ocean, which is special. 
That's Stephen dweck, with spring/summer '99 collection. Elsa Klensch, 
CNN, New York.
