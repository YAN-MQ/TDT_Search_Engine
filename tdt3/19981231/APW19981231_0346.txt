Russia delivered an unspecified amount of highly-enriched uranium 
to France that will be burned in two research reactors, a news report 
said Thursday. The shipment was the first of many uranium deliveries 
called for under a 1996 technological cooperation agreement signed 
between France and Russia. The uranium will be used in two government 
research reactors, including one in Grenoble, the Interfax news agency 
reported, citing Russia's Nuclear Energy Ministry. The report did 
not say how much uranium was delivered, or how much France paid for 
it. The agreement is part of an effort by the West to encourage Russia 
to safely dispose of its old nuclear materials. The West wants to 
keep the uranium away from states that might be trying to develop 
nuclear weapons programs. With the delivery, Russia will be able to 
raise revenues and defray Soviet-era debts to France for energy sector 
equipment.
