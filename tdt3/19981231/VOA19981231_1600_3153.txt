Russia says its inflation reached 84 percent this year. That's almost 
eight times the level of 1997. The National Statistics Committee released 
the figures on New Year's Eve. The statistics also show the Russian 
economy shrunk by almost five percent in 1998, as the country continued 
to grapple with an acute financial and economic crisis. This was Russia's 
worst inflation since 1994, when it reached 131 percent. The worst 
inflationary tremor ever to hit Russia was in 1992 when prices rose 
more than 2500 percent. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has forecast 
next year's inflation will be about 30 percent.
