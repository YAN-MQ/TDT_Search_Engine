When we come back -- a multibillion dollar industry with a product 
that might have side effects. Whoa! Remember this place and those 
midnight snacks? Hi, guys. Mindy! Let's have 2 dogs with the works. 
Hey, I can't have one of those now. Watching your figure? No, I didn't 
take my pepcid ac and it's too late now. Take my tagamet-- you can 
eat now. Tagamet introduces a better way to avoid heartburn. Not before, 
not after--now! Now you can take tagamet right when you're gonna eat 
and still prevent heartburn. Mindy? You two... back again? Mindy! 
With tagamet, you can eat like a kid again. - Rure is gut to clear 
things up. here's sure clear dry. - Lookswhite solid. - Yeah, but 
it's clearly BETTER because when you put it on-- - it's clear. So 
why is clear and dry important? We want further proof. Okay. We gotta 
pit your left side against your sure side. - We're not doin' that! 
- Put sure clear dry on your right armpit right now. Now this is another 
brand. oh, no. Try under your left arm. All right. Which side do you 
think will be clear and dry? - The sure side. - So what could you 
do with sure clear dry? - Lift up my arms. - Salsa dance. That's sure 
clear dry.
