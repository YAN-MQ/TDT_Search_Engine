A day after firing its naval chief, the Indian government on Thursday 
installed a new chief of the air force. The retirement of the air 
force commander left just one of the three service chiefs in place. 
The defense secretary, the senior civil servant in the defense ministry, 
also was shifted from his post in Wednesday's shakeup. Air Chief Marshal 
Anil Yashwant Tipnis took over as the new Chief of Air Staff from 
S.K. Sareen. Indian newspapers, headlining the unprecedented removal 
of the navy commander, Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat, said it highlighted 
tensions between India's civilian governments and its top military 
officers. Unlike other armies in South Asia, the Indian army is not 
involved in politics, and a military coup has never been a threat. 
``This issue is not likely to go away,'' wrote K. Subramaniam, the 
respected defense analyst of The Times of India. ``It is public knowledge 
that the three service chiefs of staff had complained to the defense 
minister earlier'' about the ministry's handling of their affairs. 
Bhagwat was fired for his refusal to accept the appointment of a new 
deputy. The naval chief claimed he had the legal authority to choose 
his principal officers, and he was not required to accept the government's 
nominee. The government judged his stand to be insubordination toward 
civilian authority. A statement released Wednesday said his action 
``threatened the established structure of democracy, traditional neutrality 
and objectivity of the armed forces.'' Bhagwat was replaced by Vice-Admiral 
Sushil Kumar, who previously was in charge of naval operations in 
south India. Tipnis, a former fighter pilot and a 39-year veteran, 
said Bhagwat's dismissal was ``the most unfortunate thing to happen,'' 
but declined further comment, United News of India reported. But a 
retired naval chief, Admiral O.S. Dawson, was quoted by Press Trust 
of India as faulting the government for ineptly handling the conflict 
with Bhagwat and failing to hold a full inquiry before firing him. 
``Sacking anybody without any good ground is a bad thing. If anybody 
deserved to be sacked, do not do it this way,'' said Dawson, who was 
naval chief in the early 1980s.
