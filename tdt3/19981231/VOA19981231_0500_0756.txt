A Cambodian pro-democracy group has blasted the Phnom Penh government 
for giving safe haven to two senior leaders of the once dreaded Khmer 
Rouge. The Khmer Institute of Democracy called the preferential treatment 
given Ku Som Ponh and Nuan Chia a disgrace to the Cambodian nation. 
Prime Minster Han Sen has indicated that neither Khmer Rouge leader 
will face any kind of punishment. Domestic and foreign human rights 
advocates want both men tried for crimes against humanity relating 
a four-year reign of terror that nearly destroyed Cambodia in the 
1970s. Estimates of the death toll from execution, torture, starvation, 
and disease are put at 1.7 million people.
