Predicting the future is always dangerous, especially in the world 
of finance, but if 1998 was the year of the global economic meltdown, 
what does 1999 have in store. From The World's business desk in New 
York, Liz George gazes into here crystal ball. Worldwide, the economy's 
expected to slow next year. Even the United States, which could be 
described as the locomotive driving global growth, isn't likely to 
escape the impact of contagion. Some estimates predict economic growth 
to slow by about 2 1/2 percent. So, will it be likely to be more cuts 
in interest rates in 1999 to stoke up the economy. Abby Cohen is managing 
director with Goldman Sachs. I think it's possible that US interest 
rates may continue to fall, primarily because inflation is so low 
in the United States. And as a result real or inflation adjusted interest 
rates are still rather large and could have movement downward. However, 
dramatic reduction in interest rates are not necessarily part of our 
forecast. Rather in 1999, I think the principle stimulus behind rising 
stock prices will be investors' increased confidence that the economy's 
growing and profits are increasing. Meanwhile stock markets too are 
likely to return to less exuberant levels something that will impact 
upon the wealth of individuals in the United States. Abby Cohen again. 
What we are trying to communicate to our clients is that 1999 will 
be a good year, but not necessarily an abnormally good year. What's 
the key reason? Well, in previous years when stock prices rose 20 
to 30 percent in the United States, we started from levels that I 
consider to be undervalued. That the stocks were just selling to cheaply 
given how well the economy and corporations were doing. Today, I think 
stocks are roughly at fair value, based upon what has happened in 
1998. They are modestly undervalued based upon 1999. And so, the upside 
will be somewhat more limited. Japan's economic outlook also remains 
uncertain with the risk that confidence and consumer spending there 
will remain depressed. And Latin America and other emerging markets 
may have difficulties in making debt payments unless foreign investments 
begin to rise again. And big swings in exchange rates among the currencies 
of the large industrialized nations including the new euro could be 
destabilizing. So, the financial outlook for 1999 remains a cautious 
one. For the World, I'm Liz George in New York.
