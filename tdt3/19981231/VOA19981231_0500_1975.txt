Several kidnapped western tourist just freed in Yemen say their kidnappers 
used them as human shields when Yemeni government troops opened fire 
in a rescue effort. Four tourists - three Brits and an Australian 
- died in the shooting Tuesday; 12 others survived the ordeal. Yemen 
says its forces attacked the kidnappers after it became clear that 
some of the hostages were being killed, but that doesn't match what 
the freed tourists are saying. Several of them say there was no shooting 
until the troops launched their rescue effort. The British and Australian 
governments have demanded a full explanation of the incident by authorities 
in Yemen.
