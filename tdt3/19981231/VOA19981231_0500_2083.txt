A Tanzanian judge has extended a detention order against two men held 
in connection with the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam. 
VOA's Scott Sterns reports prosecutors say they are still preparing 
the case. Magistrate for Justice Rugazio remanded the suspects for 
another two weeks while waiting to rule whether enough evidence exists 
for a full trial. If convicted by Tanzania's high court, the men could 
face death by hanging. Egyptian Mustafo Mohammed Said Ahmed and Zanzabori 
Rashidsale Hemed are accused of taking part in the August 7th bombing 
of the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam that killed 11 Tanzanians and 
wounded more than 70. A near simultaneous truck bomb in the Kenyan 
capital Nairobi killed 213 people including 12 Americans. Thousands 
were wounded, many blinded by flying glass. U.S. prosecutors accuse 
Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden of organizing the bombings. He's 
calling for attacks against American and British civilians in retaliation 
for their country's air strikes against Iraq. Police say Mr. Ahmed 
fought in Afghanistan until the war ended in 1992. Then he came to 
Africa where they say he was helped by a friend of Mr. bin Laden, 
Ali Amin Arashidi. Mr. Arashidi drowned off the Kenyan coast in 1996. 
Mr. Ahmed and Mr. Hemed next to appear in court January 15th. Defense 
attorneys complain investigations into the blasts are going to slow 
with Mr. Ahmed's lawyer, Abdul Moingala saying they've been given 
no serious reason for continuing to adjourn the case. Mr. Moingala 
says the probe launched by Tanzanian police and the U.S. Federal Bureau 
of Investigations seems like it's going to take more than 30 years 
to complete. Magistrate Rugazio was also critical of the pace of the 
proceedings saying prosecutors have not let the court know the state 
of the investigation. U.S. officials are offering a $5 million reward 
for information leading to the arrest of five other suspects in the 
bombing: two Tanzanians and three Kenyans. Several suspects have already 
been extradited to the United States. Scott Sterns, VOA News, East
