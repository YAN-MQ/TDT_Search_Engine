The International Olympic Committee says it is strong enough to weather 
a current controversy surrounding Salt Lake City, Utah's bid to host 
the 2002 Winter Olympics. In a year-end newsletter, the IOC said the 
Olympic movement is strong enough to overcome the challenge presented 
by the bribery and influence scandal. IOC president, Juan Antonio 
Samaranc has said he will oust any members of the committee found 
guilty of corruption. The Olympic committee is conducting one of four 
investigations into whether members took scholarships, gifts, and 
free medical services in exchange for voting for Salt Lake City. The 
U.S. Justice Department, the U.S. Olympic Committee, and the Salt 
Lake organizing committee are also investigating the scandal. Mr. 
Samaranc has said that under no circumstances will Salt Lake City 
lose the right to host the 2002 games.
