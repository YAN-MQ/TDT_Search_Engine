Europe's dream of monetary union becomes reality Thursday when 11 
nations irrevocably lock their currencies together to form the euro 
and create an economic giant whose boundaries stretch from beyond 
the Arctic Circle to the shores of the Mediterranean. The euro's birth 
is being hailed as a historic turning point in international finance 
and is arguably the greatest single step in the drive to create a 
united Europe from the ruins of World War II. ``This Dec. 31, 1998, 
will be one of the great dates in the history of the 20th century,'' 
French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, told France Info radio. 
``It's the beginning of a new era.'' On what Europeans are calling 
``E-day,'' economic and finance ministers from the 11 nations huddled 
at European Union headquarters to adopt the rates at which their currencies 
are absorbed into euro. They agreed the euro will be worth 1.95583 
German marks, 6.55957 French francs, 1936.27 Italian lire, 166.386 
Spanish pesetas. After the ministers' solemn speeches, schoolchildren 
released thousands of blue balloons bearing the ``e'' symbol which 
may soon become as familiar as the dollar sign.
