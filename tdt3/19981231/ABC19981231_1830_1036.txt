Just a few hours left in the 1998 tax year, which means you're running 
out of time to collect any last-minute deductions. All year we track 
how the government spends that money you contribute, "Your money." 
And so we asked John Martin to go back and see what's happened to 
some of the spending abuses he uncovered. What do you suppose a drug 
dealer in the nightclub business thinks is the easiest way to steal 
"your money"? In January, we asked one. The answer -- Medicare. Bueno, 
Medicare. You laundered drug money, you were in the nightclub business, 
medicare was better than drugs or nightclubs? si. Eight months after 
our story, auditors estimated Medicare paid $11.6 million to what 
it thought were medical laboratories, but which turned out to be places 
like this pizza parlor or this cake store. Medicare now says it will 
send inspectors to check the sites.
