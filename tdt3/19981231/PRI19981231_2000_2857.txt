Hi. I am Buroto Maro from the BBC World Service and I want to say 
Happy New Year! Or as we say in Latin America on PRI, Public Radio 
International. The World is made possible in part by Merck, a research 
driven pharmaceutical company discovering, developing, and manufacturing 
a broad range of human and animal health products and services. Merck 
committed to bringing out the best in medicine. And The World is brought 
to you by the Capital Group, investing throughout the world for individuals 
and institutions.
