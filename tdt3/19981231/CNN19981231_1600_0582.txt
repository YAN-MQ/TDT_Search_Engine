Tomorrow will Mark the beginning of an economic era once considered 
an impossible dream. A currency is being adopted that will lock together 
11 European nations. Rym Brahimi reports the task of switching over 
won't be easy. As the world ushers in the new year, another event 
is being marked in Europe Friday -- E-day, or Euro-day. That's when 
the dream of European monetary union becomes reality, and the euro 
becomes the official currency in 11 countries of Europe. Stock exchanges, 
banks and other financial institutions in Europe face a Logistical 
nightmare as they race to adapt computer systems before the markets 
reopen on Monday morning. To prepare for the changeover, 30,000 specialists 
are working through a 100-hour weekend to bring financial institutions 
on the continent up to speed. We have about 500 people in Europe working 
full-time. It is a major logistical effort. Despite not being part 
of the Euro inauguration, Britain is still considered a major contender 
in European economics. Frankfurt still has to establish itself as 
a major financial center, whereas London is already a major financial 
center. While consumers in Europe won't actually start spending Euro 
coins or bills for another three years, some are certainly enjoying 
all the hoopla surrounding the launch. One Frenchman says he is happy 
about the change, because if he wins the national French lottery he 
can now receive euros instead of French francs. Do I prefer winning 
in euros or in francs? In euros! I'll have the feeling of having more 
money. Bankers and analysts around the world hope the Euro will be 
a Winner, too. Rym Brahimi, CNN, London.
