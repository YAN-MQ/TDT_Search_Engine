The U.N. Security Council will hold an emergency meeting today to 
press Angola's government and Unita rebels to allow searches for possible 
survivors of a downed U.N. aircraft in Central Angola. U.N. officials 
say an emergency signal received from the plane after the crash raised 
hopes that some of the 14 people on board might still be alive. Meanwhile, 
at the war front, Unita rebel forces shelled Angola's second largest 
city, Huambo, on Wednesday, and renewed their assault on the provincial 
capital, Quito.
