Having spent three full days without a game in sunny Arizona, the 
Rangers were rested and ready for Wednesday night's match against 
the Coyotes. With all three members of their first line out of the 
lineup, the Coyotes were weakened against the visitors from New York. 
As is often the case under these circumstances, the team that would 
seem to have the advantage was the team that played poorly and lost 
while the team that seemed to be at a disadvantage played well and 
won. Despite taking an early lead, the Rangers were sometimes frustrated 
and sometimes lethargic in losing by 3-1 before a howling capacity 
crowd in America West Arena. Niklas Sundstrom scored the Rangers' 
only goal. With Phoenix leading by 2-1 midway through the third period, 
Daniel Briere scored an insurance goal on a high wrist shot at the 
12-minute mark. ``It usually works in reverse,'' Brian Leetch, the 
Rangers' captain, said, referring to the logic of predicting a game 
like this. ``We got outworked in our own zone.'' When asked if his 
team was stale, Rangers Coach John Muckler said that he could not 
use that as an excuse. In an unusual departure from his standard demeanor, 
Muckler criticized several players by name. He mentioned that John 
MacLean ``can't put the puck in,'' on a breakaway. And that Kevin 
Stevens ``missed a whole open net'' on a power play. He pointed out 
that Todd Harvey ``turned over the puck,'' on Briere's scoring play. 
After that goal, Harvey smashed his stick over the top of the Rangers' 
net. After the game, he trashed himself. ``The hand made it O.K.,'' 
he said of his injured right thumb, ``but it was everything else that 
was a problem.'' Harvey said it was his worst game as a member of 
the Rangers. The Rangers resume the trip on Thursday night in Denver 
against the Colorado Avalanche. ``It doesn't get any easier,'' said 
Adam Graves. Wayne Gretzky, who played more than 20 minutes, was held 
without a shot on goal. ``As the game went on, they got stronger and 
we seemed to fade,'' Gretzky said. ``It was a bad loss for us.'' The 
Coyotes held a 2-1 lead after two periods despite playing without 
all three members of their top line. Keith Tkachuk, the left wing 
with 17 goals, will miss three weeks with a broken rib. Jeremy Roenick, 
the center with 14 goals, will miss about a week with a concussion. 
Dallas Drake, the right wing with six goals, is serving a four-game 
suspension for a violent check of Doug Bodger of the Los Angeles Kings. 
Although Phoenix was the best team in the league for the first quarter 
of the season, it has had less success in recent games. Coming into 
Wednesdsay night's match, the Coyotes had been 3-4 in their previous 
seven. Starting in goal for the Rangers, for the first time in more 
than a month, was Dan Cloutier, the rookie who is the backup for Mike 
Richter. Cloutier made several sharp saves in the first period as 
the Rangers were outplayed, often hemmed in their own zone by the 
aggressive skating and checking of the Phoenix players. Scoring for 
New York was Sundstrom, at 1:25. After Petr Nedved drew two checkers 
toward him at the blue line, he passed the puck to Mike Knuble, who 
moved it right to left to Sundstrom. Goalie Nikolai Khabibulin had 
committed far to the right-wing side, so Sundstrom had lots of empty 
net to fill with a long, backhanded shot from the left side. Phoenix 
tied the score at 1-1 at 6:48 of the second on a goal by Bob Corkum, 
who scored off a rush after Ranger defenseman Rumun Ndur was caught 
up ice, along the left boards. Corkum beat Cloutier with a wrist shot 
from the inside edge of the right-wing circle. Phoenix made it 2-1 
at 18:16 on a goal by Rick Tocchet, who was uncovered in front on 
a play that began with Greg Adams winning a face-off from Gretzky. 
Back in the lineup for the Rangers was Harvey, a right wing who missed 
the last two games with an injured right thumb. At the morning practice 
on Wednesday, Harvey still had the hand wrapped in a bandage and he 
treated it with ice after the skate. ``It's a bone bruise, and probably 
something with the tendons and ligaments,'' Harvey said. ``It's not 
100 percent, but it's time to play.'' Despite the mistake on the first 
Phoenix goal, Ndur took a regular shift alongside Jeff Beukeboom. 
In the previous game, a 6-3 victory at Carolina, Ndur assisted on 
Stevens's goal for his first point in the National Hockey League. 
Ndur said he did not even know he was credited with an assist until 
the puck was handed to him on the bench. ``I was pretty pumped about 
it,'' said Ndur, who is 23 years old. ``First point! It really meant 
a lot to me.''
