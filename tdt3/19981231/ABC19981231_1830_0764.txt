New federal rules to make drinking water safer start taking effect 
over the coming year. So many people are worried about the quality 
of tap water that they've switched to bottled water. But as ABC's 
George strait reports, they may have traded one health problem for 
another. What began as a trickle 15 years ago is now a flood. Concerns 
about the safety and taste of tap water have turned bottled water 
into a $7 billion-A-year industry. What many assumed was a safe alternative 
is having dangerous, unintended consequences. Increased cavities, 
especially in children. We saw it almost eliminated back in the '70s 
and '80s, and now, with people not drinking fluoridated water, we 
are seeing an almost vengeful return of cavities. The American dental 
association blames bottled water, because most products do not contain 
fluoride, the Mineral that helps prevent tooth decay. What we are 
most concerned with is, most parents don't even know they are putting 
their children at risk. Is that starting to feel a little sleepy? 
Brenden Perry is one of those kids. He's only 8 and already has four 
cavities. It alarmed his mother. It didn't dawn on me until after 
I talked with the dentist and he asked if we were big drinkers of 
bottled water. Then I realized that this could be such a big problem. 
And you, a school nurse -- yes. Ironically, what has become a problem 
for so many children is turning into a potential bonanza for the manufacturers 
of bottled water. More than a dozen have just begun adding fluoride 
to some of their products. In only three months, aone, aimed at children, 
has become the number one seller for its manufacturer. Parents told 
us they would like to start their kids off early on with healthy habits. 
Our fluoridated alternative offers that to the consumer. But these 
fluoridated alternatives are not available nationwide, until they 
are, dentists warn, this water has risk, too. George strait, ABC News, 
Washington.
