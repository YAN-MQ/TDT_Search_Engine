This city at a bend in the Congo River will soon become the new rebel 
headquarters, in a move that concedes a reality no one bothers to 
hide anymore: the rebellion may control ever-growing chunks of Congo, 
but it remains deeply unpopular with the people. It is not hard to 
see why. The other evening Sadiki Tabou, 33, who washes cars for a 
living and does not make much anyway, was reduced to planting a table-sized 
plot in an incongruous place: next to Kisangani's port, which has 
been closed since the rebellion began in August and is thus empty 
of the flour, dried fish, salt and oil that normally float in huge 
barges up the river. ``I would like to get some work and eat two times 
a day,'' Tabou said. ``But that's not happening.'' The rebels' move 
to Kisangani _ closer to the center of Congo than their current headquarters 
in Goma at the far eastern border _ is just one step they hope will 
help win the hearts and minds of the Congolese people. Their failure 
to gain much support after nearly five months, they increasingly acknowledge, 
has weighed down their drive to oust President Laurent Kabila, who 
took office in 1997 after a similar war and is not very popular either. 
In fact, rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba has been pushing for 
a negotiated settlement to the war _ in part because he says he is 
worried that certain elements of his own rebellion, particularly soldiers, 
might forget their promises of democracy if they won by military might 
alone. ``There will be these limitations of the victors feeling like 
they are the bosses, and nobody else should be around,'' Wamba dia 
Wamba, president of the Congolese Rally for Democracy, said in an 
interview. ``For us, the important thing, the crucial thing, is political 
victory.'' Though the rebels tried at first to minimize their popularity 
problems, there has been no hiding it. They tried early on to reach 
out to student groups and tribal leaders in the territory they now 
hold _ perhaps a third of the country _ with minimal success. That 
failure, some experts say, has irritated Uganda, which along with 
Rwanda is backing the rebels with troops and other military support. 
There is much speculation that Uganda has become friendly with a second 
rebel group, led by Jean-Pierre Bemba, a businessman and son of one 
of Congo's richest men, looking to broaden the appeal of the drive 
to overthrow Kabila. Wamba dia Wamba, who has been hostile to the 
idea of a second rebel force, said his group's plans included repairing 
the road from Kisangani to Bunia, 350 miles northeast and across Lake 
Albert from Uganda. That would provide work as well as create a route 
for goods that have stopped coming upriver and now must arrive by 
air. He said they were planning sanitation projects, mostly to provide 
clean water. The rebels have also been reaching out to other groups 
opposed to Kabila. They appear to have forged a deal with a fierce 
but fickle faction in eastern Congo: the Mayi-Mayi, a loose group 
of perhaps thousands of warriors who have fought both for and against 
Kabila. Serge Mukendi, secretary-general for the Workers and Peasants 
Movement of Congo, which purports to represent a large faction of 
the Mayi-Mayi, said the rebellion needed to convince people that it 
was a genuine force of Congolese people hungry for deep change. ``We 
need to clean it _ dry and sunshine _ so it will smell good again,'' 
said Mukendi, who _ oddly in the rain forests of Congo _ added that 
he had once worked as an organizer at Local 1199, the hospital union 
in New York. He said that until now the rebellion had been too tightly 
associated with its foreign backers, especially Rwanda. Rwandans are 
strongly disliked in much of Congo, partly because of hostility to 
the Tutsi ethnic group, which governs Rwanda. More concretely, Mukendi 
said, many people hold Rwandan soldiers responsible for much of the 
killing in the rebellion that brought Kabila to power. In that fight 
the Rwandans and Ugandans backed Kabila the same way they are backing 
his opponents now. Kabila has bolstered his popularity by casting 
the rebellion as an invasion by forces from Uganda and Rwanda. That 
widespread view has helped draw in still more foreign soldiers _ from 
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad _ to defend Kabila's government. 
Here in Kisangani it is far from clear that the rebels' plans are 
ambitious enough to win them much support. Timing is part of the problem. 
The city, which residents say was looted when Kabila took power, is 
not happy about another war. In addition, it was easier for Kabila 
because he was fighting Mobutu Sese Seko, who had ruled the country, 
then called Zaire, for 32 years. ``The first war,'' Wamba dia Wamba 
said, ``all you have to do is say, `Mobutu has to go.' Everybody says, 
`Hooray.' But the second war you say, `Kabila has to go,' and they 
say, `Why didn't you give him a chance?''' Perhaps most important, 
though, the war has brought tremendous hardship to Kisangani. Commerce 
has all but halted. Food prices have soared. Medicine is hard to come 
by, said Dr. Soki Um-Lay, 42, medical director of Kisangani's public 
hospital. He recently led a tour of the grounds, passing first through 
a ward with 30 children suffering from malnutrition, an affliction 
that he said had started only with the current rebellion. Several 
were soldiers' children. He stopped in intensive care to talk with 
Garcon Mbale, 34, a former domestic worker who has wasted away to 
near nothing and looked away when asked what was making him sick. 
Um-Lay said the doctors had first assumed Mbale had AIDS. ``We tested 
him, and he doesn't,'' the doctor said. ``All he needs is food.''
