A leading Senate Republican on Thursday called a special House committee's 
findings that China obtained or stole some of the United States' most 
sensitive military technology ``extremely troubling,'' and said the 
Senate should act quickly to address the problems. Sen. Fred Thompson, 
R-Tenn., who last year led an investigation into China's efforts to 
funnel covert contributions to the 1996 U.S. election campaigns, said 
his Governmental Affairs Committee may hold additional hearings into 
the issues raised by the House panel. ``These are extremely troubling 
findings,'' Thompson said in telephone interview. ``But it should 
come as no surprise to those who have been following our export policies 
and the activities of the Chinese.'' ``It's been well known for some 
time that China has been actively involved in trying to obtain technology 
information, and I believe that our policies have played into their 
efforts,'' Thompson said. The House committee concluded that over 
the past two decades, China obtained, sometimes by theft, some of 
the country's most sensitive military technology, including nuclear-weapons 
design. Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who chairs the House panel 
investigating the technology transfers, said on Wednesday that the 
nine-member committee unanimously approved a report concluding that 
``national security harm did occur.'' ``These transfers are not limited 
to missile-satellite technology, but cover militarily significant 
technologies,'' Cox told reporters, citing ``serious, sustained'' 
efforts by China during the Reagan, Bush and Clinton administrations 
to acquire sensitive U.S. military technology. Clinton administration 
officials said Thursday they did not expect to receive a copy of the 
700-page report until next week. The classified five-volume report 
contains 38 specific recommendations for legislative remedies and 
executive-branch actions. The recommendations cover a wide range of 
issues, from security at the nuclear laboratories to the handling 
of intelligence data to export-control policies. But until Congress 
and the administration can agree on a declassified version of the 
report in the next several weeks, lawmakers and policy-makers said 
it would be difficult to discuss the findings and their significance. 
Government officials familiar with the report said, however, that 
the findings agree with assessments by the Pentagon and State Department 
that information shared with Chinese scientists by two U.S. companies, 
Hughes Electronics Corp. and Loral Space and Communications, had improved 
Beijing's ability to launch satellites and long-range ballistic missiles. 
The most explosive part of the report may be evidence of a pattern 
that China stole nuclear-weapons design technology from U.S. nuclear 
laboratories, said one person who has read the report. In Beijing 
on Thursday, a government spokesman expressed China's ``strong resentment'' 
of the House report. ``Normal exchanges on technology and trade between 
China and the United States serve the common interests of both sides,'' 
said Zhu Bangzao, spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, at a regularly 
scheduled press conference. The House report ``is totally groundless 
and irresponsible,'' he said, adding that China hopes the United States 
will ``take practical measures to eliminate barriers in our normal 
trade and technology relationship, not the opposite.''
