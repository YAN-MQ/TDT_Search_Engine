A new opinion poll shows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
trailing Labor Party leader Ehud Barack in a crowded race for prime 
minister. As correspondent David Gullis reports from Jerusalem, Israelis 
will vote May 17th for the possible run off two weeks later. A poll 
by the Gallup organization for the newspaper, "Maharif," showed Labor 
leader Barack ahead of Mr. Netanyahu by a 34 to 31 percent margin 
but with a growing list of splinter candidates cutting into the support 
of both. Newly retired Army general and centrist candidate Amnon Lipkin 
Shahach was third in the poll with 17 percent, while right wing contender 
Benny Begin was fourth with ten percent. In all seven candidates are 
running and the fragmentation suggests the race will go to a run off. 
The campaign is expected to be fought over the future of the peace 
process with the Palestinians. The Israeli newspaper, "Haareds" reports 
that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is pressing Palestinian leader 
Yasir Arafat to put off the statehood declaration he has been threatening 
to make May 4th so it will not figure in the election. David Gullis, 
VOA news, Jerusalem.
