Kevin Spacey describes his career strategy straightforwardly: ``In 
life, you have to make your own fate,'' he said. This is, however, 
a deceptively simple formula considering that Spacey is producing 
one of the most complex, respected and frenetic bodies of acting work, 
with a whole new chapter about to open. He has an Oscar and a Tony, 
a critically acclaimed revival of ``The Iceman Cometh'' coming to 
Broadway in the spring after a run in London, two movies in progress 
and one in the theaters _ well, two if you count his part as the voice 
of the demonic Hopper in the animated ``A Bug's Life.'' And now his 
year-old production company, Trigger Street Productions, has cut a 
deal with the studio Fine Line Features. Oh, and don't worry about 
him taking his time mulling over script ideas. He said that the company 
was already planning to shoot a movie version of the play ``Hospitality 
Suite,'' and that he expected to direct what he called ``a bigger, 
more personal story, maybe in a year or so.'' Some movies he may just 
produce, without appearing in front of or behind the camera, he said. 
``I wanted to do something that wasn't a vanity deal,'' said Spacey, 
referring to the fact that many studios offer successful actors production 
arrangements that actually generate few if any movies. ``There's a 
real opportunity for my company to become a player.'' The company's 
deal with Fine Line Cinema, a unit of Time Warner's New Line, allows 
him to retain foreign distribution rights on some of his films and 
to create over time a library of movies in which he will own a substantial 
interest. ``I'm interested in walking down roads I haven't walked 
down before,'' Spacey said. At this busy time in his career it is 
striking, though, that he is currently appearing in ``Hurlyburly,'' 
a movie that represents an unusually well-trodden road. As Spacey 
noted, when he made the leap from regional theater to the New York 
stage some years ago, it was by acting in ``Hurlyburly.'' In fact, 
he said, he played almost every part in the dark drama before the 
run was through and his career had begun. In the film, he plays the 
smooth, reptilian Mickey. Spacey spoke by telephone from the set of 
``American Beauty,'' a movie being directed by Sam Mendes, who also 
directed the revival of ``Cabaret'' and ``The Blue Room,'' both on 
Broadway now. ``American Beauty,'' an examination of a marriage, is 
expected in theaters perhaps late next summer or fall. Spacey has 
finished filming ``Ordinary Decent Criminal,'' set in Ireland, which 
may come out in the spring. That is when he will appear on Broadway 
as Hickey in ``The Iceman Cometh.'' Spacey said he expected his company 
to make both low-budget, independent movies as well as costly studio 
productions but, he stressed, not because one is easier than the other. 
``I try just as hard,'' Spacey said. ``That camera has no idea what 
the budget is.'' Finding Joy in Directing There was a time when Michael 
Cristofer seemed to have it all as a writer. After winning both a 
Pulitzer Prize and a Tony for his Broadway play, ``The Shadow Box,'' 
in 1978, Cristofer ventured into movies and had quick successes writing 
the screenplays for ``Falling in Love'' and ``The Witches of Eastwick.'' 
But then came disaster, when he wrote the script for ``The Bonfire 
of the Vanities,'' the disappointing film version of Tom Wolfe's novel. 
That was followed by well-paying but little-noticed work on movies 
like ``Boys on the Side.'' So, cynical and somewhat stale, by his 
own admission, Cristofer did what all his friends warned him against: 
He became a director. The result, he said, is something close to bliss 
as he moves to complete his first feature film, ``Jello Shots,'' an 
ensemble piece about young-adult angst. Cristofer's first directorial 
job was on the highly regarded ``Gia,'' the tragic tale of the real-life 
model's rise and fall, which he made for HBO. That led to ``Jello 
Shots,'' a roughly $15 million film for New Line Cinema. Shooting 
wrapped on Dec. 19, with release scheduled for next fall. ``I'm in 
pig heaven,'' said Cristofer of his new career as a director. ``Everyone 
said: `You'll hate this. Don't make this mistake.' But the opposite 
was true.'' ``I just felt I couldn't do the writing anymore,'' he 
added. ``I told myself that if I'm going to make movies, I have to 
make the movies.'' Cristofer hasn't completely given up writing; in 
fact, he did extensive rewriting on ``Jello Shots,'' whose original 
screenplay was written by David McKenna. But he said he was happy 
to be focusing on the visual aspects of filmmaking, particularly in 
his new movie, a complex exploration of young people discovering how 
explosive and unsettling sex can be. ``Jello Shots'' is vaguely reminiscent 
of ``200 Cigarettes,'' another coming-of-age movie scheduled for release 
in 1999. Like that film, ``Jello Shots'' involves a group of young 
people _ four couples, in this case _ getting drunk and spending an 
evening together. In ``Jello Shots,'' the couples struggle through 
sexual encounters that leave them baffled or, in one instance, hurt, 
with the woman claiming she'd been raped, and the man denying it. 
The couples wrestle with the question of whether she can be believed, 
but the real point, Cristofer said, is how these people discover that 
sex can push them farther apart rather than pull them closer together. 
``The issue isn't whether there was date rape, but for these people, 
on the brink of adulthood, how do you accomplish intimacy with another 
person,'' Cristofer said. Meanwhile, he said, he has not given up 
on the theater; he wrote ``Amazing Grace,'' which ran in New York 
last year. ``It's like a bad habit you keep trying to kill but can't,'' 
he said. ``It's like charity work.'' He added, ``It's a good thing 
the directing thing is really taking off.'' Raves for Comfy Seats 
The movie studios have enjoyed an excellent holiday season, as a sort 
of a cherry on top of the banana-split of a year they have had at 
the box office, and film executives attribute at least part of the 
success to an unexpected source: good seats. Competition in the entertainment 
industry has grown enormously, shaking up the television and music 
businesses, but the movie business has had a record year. According 
to Exhibitor Relations, which tracks box-office results, theaters 
sold $6.94 billion worth of tickets this year, a 9 percent increase 
from $6.36 billion in 1997. Over the three-day Christmas weekend, 
box-office receipts set a record, rising 2 percent from last year 
to $147.2 million. And this came in spite of the fact that there were 
no blockbusters, just lots of solid singles and doubles, plus a triple. 
Seven of the movies in release earned more than $10 million over the 
weekend. ``Those are mind-shattering figures,'' said Phil Barlow, 
president of Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, the distribution arm 
of Walt Disney Studios. The greatest surprise may have been the triple, 
``Patch Adams,'' the Robin Williams comedy from the beleaguered Universal 
Studios, which took in $25.3 million in spite of generally poor reviews. 
But lots of other films performed well, including Disney's ``Mighty 
Joe Young,'' about an oversized gorilla, which took in $10.6 million 
in spite of strong competition from other children's movies, like 
``A Bug's Life'' and ``The Rugrats Movie.'' Many studio executives 
attributed the strong results, as might be expected, to the quality 
of their products. But they also generally agreed that the proliferation 
of multiplex theaters with far more comfortable seats, often in a 
stadium configuration, and better sound systems has helped bring in 
the crowds. ``There's no question the multiplexes are having a big 
impact,'' Barlow said. ``They're the shopping mall of theaters. Everything 
is better.'' Nikki Rocco, president of distribution at Universal, 
added: ``I give a lot of the credit to the new theaters. The stadium 
seating is so much more comfortable and you don't have to worry about 
looking at the back of someone's head.'' Paul Dergarabebian, president 
of Exhibitor Relations, also said that while many factors made this 
a big year, the new theaters were increasingly important. ``The sound 
quality is so good,'' he said. ``The seats are great.'' Another happy 
surprise over the holiday weekend was that the three top-grossing 
films were all aimed at adults rather than young men, the group that 
has sent ticket sales soaring on a number of pictures this year. ``Patch 
Adams,'' the first solid hit for Universal this year; ``Stepmom,'' 
a tear-jerker, and ``You've Got Mail,'' the nonsequel sequel to ``Sleepless 
in Seattle,'' were all regarded as adult films that appealed particularly 
to women. Asked about this, Ms. Rocco of Universal said, ``I'm just 
happy to have a hit.''
