Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Thursday urged the international 
community to help prevent a global recession in 1999 by increasing 
aid to Asian economies battered by a regionwide crisis. In a New Year's 
Eve address, the Chinese leader also issued an appeal to Taiwan for 
negotiations with Beijing. Jiang, wearing a dark suit, white shirt 
and red tie, was upbeat in summing up 1998, saying China victoriously 
battled devastating floods and achieved high economic growth despite 
the financial turmoil affecting other Asian nations. ``The Chinese 
people are marching to the future with increased confidence,'' Jiang 
said. Absent from the address, carried on nationwide television and 
radio, were the strident remarks against democracy campaigners which 
punctuated other speeches Jiang has given in the past two weeks. In 
those speeches, which coincided with a sharp crackdown on dissidents, 
Jiang vowed to crush any attempt to unseat the ruling Communist Party 
and said China would never copy Western-style democracy. But Jiang 
did express ``deep concern'' in his address about the ``spread and 
increasing severity'' of the Asian economic crisis. ``The international 
community should strengthen cooperation to overcome the affects of 
this economic crisis and prevent a global economic recession,'' he 
said. He called for reform and improvements of the global financial 
system and said the international community ``should enthusiastically 
help countries badly affected by this crisis out of their difficulties.'' 
Unlike many other Asian countries, China has not devalued its currency, 
the yuan, amid the regional financial crisis. Despite the harm that 
did to Chinese exports, the government said Wednesday that the economy 
grew by 7.8 percent in 1998, helped by massive public spending. ``In 
a situation where a few countries' economies went down a lot, China's 
economy was able to grow at quite a fast rate,'' Jiang noted in his 
address. He also had words of praise for Hong Kong, saying the territory 
that China got back from Britain in 1997 had also managed to remain 
stable and prosperous. He predicted that the former colony's future 
remained bright. Jiang said China would work to ensure that the return 
of Portuguese-ruled Macau to Chinese rule next December also would 
be smooth. In the next breath, Jiang addressed another major territorial 
issue which confronts the Chinese leadership: Taiwan. ``Taiwan has 
been Chinese soil since ancient times,'' he said, adding that Beijing's 
determination to see the island reunited peacefully with the mainland 
remains ``firm and unshakeable.'' ``We sincerely hope that Taiwan 
authorities will comply with the wishes of the people, squarely face 
reality and have dialogue and negotiations with us,'' he said. Taiwan's 
Nationalists have ruled the island separately from the mainland since 
they fled there in 1949 after losing a civil war to the Chinese Communists. 
In foreign policy, Jiang said China strengthened its relations with 
its neighbors in 1998 and ``achieved new progress'' in relations with 
the United States, Japan, Europe and Russia. Turning to domestic issues, 
Jiang promised stepped up measures in 1999 to boost domestic demand, 
increase exports, and overcome the affects of the Asian economic crisis. 
He also promised more help to poor areas of China and to the millions 
of workers laid off from moribund state enterprises.
