Under intense pressure to reduce its spending, the Brazilian government 
has slashed funds toward a $250 million pilot project backed by seven 
leading industrial nations that has been the centerpiece of Brazil's 
efforts to save the Amazon rain forest. Environmentalists warn that 
without Brazil's participation, the project stands to lose almost 
all the donations yet to come from the Group of Seven industrial nations. 
Under the main agreement, approved at the 1992 Earth Summit here, 
Brazil was to provide just 10 percent of the $250 million. The pilot 
program pays for surveying the rain forest, and it has been the principal 
vehicle for marking off 40,000 square miles for indigenous reservations. 
Surveying what is in the vast mysterious rain forest is seen as the 
first step toward protecting it from destruction by ranchers, loggers, 
farmers and miners. Under pressure to rein in its budget deficit, 
Brazilian government officials have slashed spending across the board. 
A recent agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which is 
spearheading a $41.3 billion standby loan for Brazil, reduces government 
spending on environmental programs by two-thirds. Under the pilot 
program, the Brazilian government provides matching funds and manpower 
to administer the Group of Seven grant. The government's revised budget, 
released in November, cuts the amount Brazil can expect to get from 
the group to $6.4 million from more than $61 million. ``It is arguably 
a far more irrational and perverse consequence of the IMF agreement 
than even the harshest critics of the IMF could have imagined,'' said 
Stephan Schwartzman, a senior scientist at the Washington-based Environmental 
Defense Fund. Covering an area half as big as the continental United 
States, the Amazon is a lush laboratory of plants, animals and bacteria 
that contains more than 20 percent of the world's fresh water supply.
