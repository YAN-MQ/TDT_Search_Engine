Finance ministers from 11 European Union countries have established 
the final exchange rates for the euro, the new single currency which 
begins Friday, New Year's Day. Ron Pemstein reports from Brussels 
on the history-making ceremony. Three thousand balloons bearing the 
euro symbol were released on the European Council Building to mark 
the formal adoption of a new currency. The finance ministers expressed 
the hope that the euro will rival the American dollar and the Japanese 
yen as the world's reserve currencies. European Central Bank president 
Vim Dowsenberg tells reporters: A currency is also part of the identity 
of a people. It reflects what they have in common now and in the future. 
Maybe euro will become a unifying symbol for the people of Europe. 
There will be no euro notes or coins until 2002 when they will replace 
all the national currencies in the 11 countries, but the euro will 
be used beginning New Year's Day in bank accounts and for credit card 
payments. Ron Pemstein, VOA News, Brussels.
