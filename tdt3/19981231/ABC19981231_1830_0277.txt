Concerns over what officials describe as a "specific threat" against 
the U.S. embassy in Israel have led to the sudden closing of that 
embassy. ABC's Gillian Findlay is in Israel tonight. No one at the 
embassy could remember it being shut down this way before. Officials 
say they're used to getting threats, but the one they received last 
night, threatening to blow up the embassy, they believe was credible. 
And these days, the state department isn't taking any chances. The 
memory of the two embassy bombings in Africa last summer is still 
too fresh, as is the anger that followed when it was learned that 
a warning of an attack against the Nairobi embassy had not been taken 
seriously. With so much of the world angry at Americans for air strikes 
against Iraq and missile attacks against targets in Afghanistan and 
Sudan, the U.S. government is being very careful. During the air strikes, 
41 U.S. embassies in Africa were shut down for two days. For weeks, 
and in some cases, months, embassies in Cambodia, Qatar, pakistan 
and Albania have offered emergency services only. What happened in 
Israel today is the latest sign of a very nervous climate for Americans 
overseas. Gillian Findlay, ABC News, Jerusalem.
