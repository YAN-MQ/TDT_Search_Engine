When we come back -- quite a year for wasting money. The "fleecing 
of America." Every year I say I'm gonna quit smoking. Day later, I'm 
at it again. Till this year. See this? My last piece of nicorette 
gum. Been smoke-free with nicorette now for 12 weeks. With nicorette, 
I helped control my cravings 2 ways. I used it on a regular schedule 
to help curb them, and then, for unexpected cravings, I took another 
piece. And now, no more craving, no more nicotine. Happy new year. 
Only nicorette helps you control your cravings, your habit, 2 ways. 
A bunch of us here in Lafayette, Colorado, ate quaker oatmeal for 
30 days. It helped reduce my cholesterol 16 points. My bowling average 
is still a little lower than my cholesterol. But I'm working on it. 
Time is running out on Buick's swing into '99. And for a short time 
only, we've got numbers that'll make your head spin. And a new twist-- 
but these numbers won't be around much longer so better jump now. 
Swing into your Buick dealer today.
