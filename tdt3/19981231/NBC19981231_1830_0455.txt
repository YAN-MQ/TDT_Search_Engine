But over the last 12 months, the Dow gained nearly 1,275 points. The 
NASDAQ rose 622 points for the year. On a year that will go down as 
the one when millions decided to run with this market. Mike Jensen 
has this story. It's the year the stock market became the national 
pastime. Good afternoon, everybody. This is M.G., along with the person 
who will cure your financial ills, the stock doctor. David Woodland 
of Aberdeen, Washington, follows the market on TV all day long, reads 
about it in the newspaper, goes online to check out his stocks. Five 
years ago, his retirement nest egg was worth just $60,000. Today, 
it's worth $220,000. And he's shopping for a vacation home. We're 
going to look in the Palm Springs area. He's one of 130 million Americans 
who made the stock market the hottest game in town this year -- better 
than the lottery. For the last four years, almost everybody has been 
a winner. 1995 -- the Dow shoots up 33%. '96 -- 26%. '97 -- 23%. This 
year -- 16%, even with the late summer plunge. Incredible gains. $6 
trillion in profits created out of thin air. Why the surge in stock 
prices? Mostly because of the booming economy. Eight years of prosperity 
and still no recession in sight. The U.S. economy is in very good 
shape and will grow at a strong pace in 1999. Where does that leave 
the market for 1999. I think a first quarter decline on the order 
of 15% to 20% will be followed by a strong balance of the year, ending 
the year with a net gain of 7% to 10%. So on the eve of the new year, 
most analysts say, as long as the world economy doesn't disintegrate, 
the good times on Wall Street will probably keep rolling. That the 
Bulls may slow down a bit, but they're not ready to quit. Mike Jensen, 
NBC news, New York.
