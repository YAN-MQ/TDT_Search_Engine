For The World, I'm Derrick Stofall in the BBC News Room in London. 
The countdown to the launch of the new European single currency, the 
euro, started today. Finance ministers from the 11 countries converting 
to the euro tomorrow fixed permanent exchange rates against their 
own national currencies. The euro is seen by it creators as a potential 
rival to the US dollar and as a motor behind further European integration. 
European Central Bank President Win Diesenberg. The European Central 
Bank wishes to contribute to insuring that comprehensive information 
is made available to the public on this historic legal act. Coins 
and notes of the old currencies will still be legal tender until the 
year 2002. The euro will be used by almost 300 million consumers. 
Irish Finance Minster Charlie McCrevy says that's a great achievement. 
I am very pleased at the long-standing objective of economic and monetary 
union is now finally being realized. The economic and monetary union 
is one of the most far-reaching and momentous steps in the history 
of the European enterprise. Irish Finance Minister Charlie McCrevy.
