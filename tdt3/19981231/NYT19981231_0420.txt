Zdeno Chara is constantly asked if he is a basketball player. The 
mistake is understandable. At 6 feet 9 inches and 255 pounds, Chara 
looks like he would be a better fit on a basketball court, not in 
a hockey rink. So in a soft voice he answers, ``No, I'm a hockey player 
for the Islanders.'' Chara had opportunities to play basketball in 
his native Slovakia, but turned them down so that he could follow 
his first love: hockey. As a rookie with the Islanders last season, 
he became the tallest player in National Hockey League history, appearing 
in the season's final 25 games. Chara's size, nearly 7-feet tall on 
skates, turns heads. But size no longer defines his game. In his second 
season with the Islanders, and at age 21, Chara is establishing himself 
as one the team's best blueliners and as one of the league's most 
feared fighters. After starting this season in the minors, Chara returned 
in late November and stunned his coaches with the extent of his improvement. 
A heavyweight who dominates the defensive zone, he has learned to 
mix thumping body checks and gloves-off toughness with smart defensive 
positioning and a nimble skating style that belies his size. These 
were technical skills he was lacking when the team demoted him in 
September. ``I put too much pressure on myself,'' said Chara, who 
signed a three-year contract with the Islanders last season. ``I was 
thinking about making the NH. and was too worried about everything. 
``Just mentally I wasn't ready, but physically I was in my best shape 
ever. It was a game in my head. I was thinking, thinking, thinking. 
I was thinking too much.'' In the minors, where he played for the 
Lowell Lock Monsters of the American Hockey League, the left-handed 
shooting Chara received the tutoring and the ice time _ about 30 minutes 
a game _ that he needed. The Islanders' coaching staff recognized 
Chara's progress after a couple of months, and the team recalled him 
when Kenny Jonsson and Rich Pilon went down with injuries. The result 
was a more confident, polished player. ``Of course, no one is glad 
they are sent down.'' Chara said recently. ``But it was good for me. 
I got my confidence back and I felt really, really good. Now, I'm 
trying to play like I did in Lowell, play good defense and not try 
to do too much.'' Chara has three assists in 13 games this season 
and is not counted on for scoring. Mike Milbury, the Islanders' coach 
and general manager, said that no matter how much Chara improves, 
he will never be a truly great skater because of his size. But his 
off-ice work ethic has endeared him to the coaches. Chara is among 
the team's most dedicated workers in the weight room. He has added 
15 pounds to his gangly frame. Footwork drills have dramatically improved 
his skating and agility. In fact, Chara trained so hard and so often 
coaches ordered him to slow down, to take more time to recover from 
the workouts. He says that his father, Zdenek Chara, a Czechoslovakian 
wrestler who competed in the 1976 Olympic games, taught him to work 
hard and persevere, whether on the ice or at the car wash in Prince 
George, B.C. where Chara worked two years ago while playing in the 
Western Hockey League for juniors. He said his boss was happy to finally 
find someone who could dry the tops of vans. ``He showed me what to 
do, how to do it and how to do it better,'' Chara said of his father, 
who still competes professionally in Slovakia. Chara spends a lot 
of time with Ziggy Palffy, a Slovak, and Robert Reichl, a Czech, because 
they can speak the same language, although he has improved his English 
by reading books and watching television. On the ice, Chara's strength 
in the corners and his board-rattling checks intimidate opposing players. 
But off of the ice he dedicates hours of his time to working in the 
community. Last season, he was in the Islanders' front office on personal 
business when he saw interns stuffing envelopes addressed to season 
ticket-holders. He pulled up a chair and began folding, and stuffing. 
``I had nothing to do,'' he said with a laugh. That is not the side 
he chooses to show opposing players. Chara has learned to better pick 
his spots, though, when it comes to fighting. But as he showed earlier 
this week at Florida, where he took on the Panthers' enforcer Peter 
Worrell, he does not hesitate when it is time to get nasty. ``People 
try to run him and see what happens,'' said Islander defenseman Scott 
Lachance, who is one of several partners Chara has been paired with 
this season. ``But most of the guys end up on the ice because he's 
tall, but he's strong. Once people try to test him they realize that 
he's solid.'' Chara's improved game has his coaches raving about him, 
and has other team's general managers coveting him. Milbury projected 
him as a solid fifth or sixth defenseman, but now, the coach believes 
he could crack the top four. ``I don't think a week goes by that a 
team doesn't inquire about him,'' Milbury said. ``I have no intention 
of moving him. It's known now; there's no point in calling.''
