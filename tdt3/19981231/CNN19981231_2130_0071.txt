And people in western Ohio are cleaning up after the heaviest snow 
storm in years. Valeri furst from affiliate wjw reports. Few would 
argue freshly fallen snow in the countryside makes a Beautiful picture. 
But living in it? Depends on your point of view. My toes, my fingers, 
my nose, it's cold. People like Bob and Sherry Hines have been waiting 
two years for this day. Last year, we didn't get much snow. And this 
year, we've been waiting up to now, and we finally got some snow today. 
Contrast that to this car with bicycles loaded on the back. That's 
one driver who can't wait to get out of town. We're on our way to 
Arizona, so we're getting out of the snow. It's like 72 in Tucson 
right now. But in southern asterbula county, dreams of warm weather 
or even seeing the ground again could be months away. This is where 
the storm hit the hardest, dumping about two feet of snow. Forecasters 
explain a snow streak is to blame. So while most of northeast Ohio 
averaged one to four inches, this area got buried. It's keeping people 
like telephone repair man John layton very busy. A lot of trouble 
reports, people out of service. And the sheriff's department. A lot 
of deputies are handling cars that are in the ditch, helping people 
out that are stuck and getting tow trucks and things like that for 
people. But despite the gray skies and snow that won't stop falling, 
people here are keeping a sunny disposition. I love this weather. 
And not letting a little snow get in the way. There's been a few times 
in 20 years that I've said, huh-uh, turned around and went back in. 
But hasn't happened very often. And got my Jeep, and it keeps me going.
