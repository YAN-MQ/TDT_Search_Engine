New York Gov. George Pataki will begin his second term Friday with 
an inaugural address that provides a glimpse of the themes he plans 
to emphasize as he seeks to broaden his reputation nationally over 
the next year. Pataki was officially sworn in Thursday night at a 
private ceremony in Albany. He is to attend a church service Friday 
morning before a public swearing-in ceremony and reception. The modest 
schedule contrasts sharply with that of four years ago, when Pataki 
and the Republicans held an extensive celebration to rejoice in having 
taken over the governor's mansion for the first time in a generation. 
Since easily winning re-election in November, Pataki has shifted some 
of his attention to the national stage, announcing that he will begin 
traveling the country to promote his brand of Republicanism, which 
combines fiscal conservatism with a moderate stance on social issues. 
He has also sought to distance himself from the Republican leaders 
in Congress at a time when their pursuit of the impeachment of President 
Clinton has hurt their standing in the polls. He has said he does 
not favor impeachment, and asserted that a censure of the president 
was more appropriate and would allow Congress to avoid getting bogged 
down in lengthy proceedings. Pataki has declined to say whether he 
is seriously considering running for president, though his aides have 
not discouraged speculation about his intentions. Such a campaign 
would probably be difficult for the governor because he favors abortion 
rights and holds other views on social issues that are at odds with 
those of the dominant, conservative wing of his party. At the inauguration 
Friday, Pataki is expected to give a relatively short speech in which 
he reviews his first term and discusses how the state can tackle the 
challenges of the next century. He is not expected to detail major 
new programs, his aides said Thursday night, holding off those announcements 
until his state of the state and budget speeches later this month.
