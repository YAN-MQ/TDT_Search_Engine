Germany, England, Brazil, South Africa, Morocco, Egypt and Ghana are 
the official candidates to host the 2006 World Cup finals. The seven 
countries all notified FIFA in advance of the Thursday night deadline 
of their intent to stage soccer's four-yearly showcase. They now have 
until the end of July to submit their full bid documents. FIFA's 24-member 
executive committee will decide in March 2000. FIFA President Sepp 
Blatter has repeatedly said the soccer authority has a responsibility 
to stage the tournament in Africa, which has never hosted the finals. 
Morocco lost out to France for the staging of the 1998 finals. Despite 
its high crime rate, South Africa is widely considered the front-runner. 
It hosted the 1995 rugby union World Cup, the 1996 African Nations 
Cup and the 1998 athletics World Cup. South African officials maintain 
they can keep crime under control and say their infrastructure is 
developed enough to cope with the demands of the tournament. ``Certainly 
emotionally there is some support for South Africa because their continent 
has never had it before,'' conceded England's bid chief Alec McGivan 
on Thursday. ``That is something we have to overcome.'' ``The question 
is when will an African candidate be ready to take on what is a huge 
logistical exercise?'' he queried. The case of both Germany and England 
has been weakened by the fact that they are from the same continent. 
The 2002 finals are being split between Japan and South Korea _ but 
FIFA insists that co-hosting will be a one-time exception. Underlining 
the increasing European rivalry, McGivan said in a radio interview 
that Germans were envious at the amount of support given by the British 
government to England's bid. He told BBC Radio 5 Live that he didn't 
think the bribery scandal rocking British soccer would be ``an issue 
at all'' in FIFA's choice of site. Hoping to boost its standing in 
the eyes of FIFA, European Champions Germany recently agreed to take 
part in next summer's Confederation Cup, after World Cup winners France 
pulled out for scheduling reasons.
