Ohio swore in its first female governor today, but she'll only serve 
for 11 days. Nancy Hollister is filling in for departing governor 
George voinovich, who was recently elected to the U.S. Senate. She'll 
hold the office until January 11th, when incoming governor Bob Taft 
will be sworn in for a full term. Hollister has been lieutenant governor 
since 1995. Today, she announced her plans for her 11 days as governor 
-- "no major initiatives and no legislation."
