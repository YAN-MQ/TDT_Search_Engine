We know another gentleman who has seen the Earth from space but only 
in his imagination. In "2001", we probably had the classic of a wheel 
like space station, in fact two wheels. Science Fiction Writer Arthur 
C. Clarke, the man who brought us "2001: A Space Odyssey", seemed 
to us to be a logical person to turn to for predictions for the new 
year and for the millennium. Clarke's track record is pretty good. 
After all, he predicted the invention of the mobile phone. Well now, 
Clarke says vacations in space aren't to far away. I'm sure that space 
tourism will be a big business from about 2020 onwards, but of course 
it does depend on the development of a cheap, reusable, spacecraft. 
We're about in space where we were in aviation I'd say about 1910. 
But, looks what happened since then in the air and the same thing's 
going to happen in space. But, you better start saving. One company 
says it hopes to charge 15 to $25,000 a head for a space getaway.
