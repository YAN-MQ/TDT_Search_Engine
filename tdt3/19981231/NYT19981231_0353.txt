The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Jan. 1: Since 
the early 1960s, the federal Food and Drug Administration has required 
pharmaceutical companies to prove through clinical tests that the 
drugs they market are safe and effective. Such tests are typically 
conducted only on adults. But new regulations effective in April will 
at last require separate testing on infants and children. Pediatricians 
have long called for separate clinical studies and labeling of drugs 
for pediatric use. Differences in metabolism, volume of body fluids 
and elimination of a drug from a child's system can cause drug responses 
that are different from that experienced by adults. Yet only about 
20 percent of all drugs marketed in the United States have been tested 
for infants and children. Many that have not been formally tested 
are routinely prescribed for children anyway. This means that doctors 
are often left guessing about a drug's effectiveness and safe dosages 
for young patients. The new regulations will require pediatric testing 
if a new drug or a new form of an old drug is likely to be used by 
children or if it provides a benefit that is not available in existing 
treatments. The regulations will allow companies to delay pediatric 
testing until after the drugs have been approved as safe for adults. 
Manufacturers also may be allowed to use some data from adult testing 
in certain cases, and to seek an exemption if the product is likely 
to be unsafe or ineffective for children or if a study would be highly 
impractical. The FDA estimates that the cost of pediatric testing 
will be less than 1 percent of the total cost of developing a new 
drug, or less than $50 million annually for all pediatric testing. 
Yet savings in reduced health costs as a result of better drug treatments 
for children are estimated at $100 million a year. This is a safeguard 
that has been put off for too long.
