Before leaving for a vacation, President Clinton telephoned Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin to discuss U.S. policy toward Iraq, an issue 
over which both countries have strongly differed, in particular, over 
the U.S. and British air strikes against Iraq early in this month. 
We get more from VOA's Nick Simeone. It was the first conversation 
between President Clinton and Yeltsin in weeks and came on the same 
day that American pilots were again in action over the skies of Iraq, 
this time targeting another Iraqi surface-to-air-missile site. During 
their 40-minute phone call, White House spokesman David Levy says 
Mr. Clinton explained to President Yeltsin why he believes force was 
necessary in dealing with Iraq's defiance of the West. Russia strongly 
opposed the U.S. and British air strikes on Iraq and temporarily recalled 
its ambassador to Washington in protest. But Spokesman Levy says both 
leaders strongly agree such differences should not be allowed to scuttle 
important issues of common concern facing them in the new year. We 
have a longstanding difference with the Russians on Iraq, and he, 
you know, again, the presidents agree that the relationship is too 
broad, too deep, too important not to go forward in a very strong, 
systematic way. Issues where both presidents hope to see progress 
include arms control, in particular, getting Russia's parliament to 
ratify the 1993 Start 2 Arms Control Treaty, which has languished 
in the Russian Duma for nearly six years. Nick Simeone, VOA News at 
the White House.
