Researchers studying schizophrenia reportedly gave healthy people 
a Powerful hallucinogen without fully informing them the drug could 
produce psychotic episodes. "The Boston globe" reports the experiments 
were done at the national institute of mental health in Maryland. 
They involved the drug ketamine, also known as "special K." The paper 
says the participants often weren't specifically told the drug would 
induce conditions similar to schizophrenia. Officials connected with 
the studies say possible side effects were mentioned on a consent 
form.
