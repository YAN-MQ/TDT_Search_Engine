The census bureau says the U.S. population grew 1% last year. The 
bureau reports Nevada was the fastest growing state for the 13th year 
in a row. The western United States was the fastest growing region 
with a rate of 1.6%. the south follows with a 1.3% increase. The midwest 
grew 0.4% and the northeast was up 0.3%. if congressional seats were 
reapportioned based on those figures, nine seats would change states. 
Reapportionment will be based on the year 2000 census.
