When we come back -- a computer time bomb. I work out to keep my body 
in shape. To help keep my mind sharp I take NEWr uanterra ginkgo biloba. 
It helps me concentrate, maintain focus. Why quanterra? All ginkgos 
aren't the same. The patented quanterra extract was proven safe and 
effective by doctors in extensive clinical trials. And it increases 
oxygen supply to the brain. With new quanterra mental sharpness I 
feel my best, naturally. I ate quaker oatmeal for 30 days. It helped 
me cut my cholesterol by 15 points. How would you describe that, Bob? 
A little off the top.
