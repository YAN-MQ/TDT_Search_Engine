A wintry mixture will plague the Plains on Friday as two centers of 
low pressure emerge from the Rocky Mountains. A swath of snow will 
occur from the Dakotas southeastward to northern Missouri. The snow 
will become heavy in some areas during the afternoon as strengthening 
breezes from the south overrun a deep cold layer near the ground. 
To the south, a treacherous combination of sleet and freezing rain 
will affect areas from northeastern Oklahoma to western Kentucky, 
with significant ice accumulations possible. Rain and thunderstorms 
will develop in the southern Mississippi Valley. An organized squall 
line of strong thunderstorms will develop late in the day near Louisiana 
as a jet-stream disturbance passes over the area. Chilly weather will 
continue over the Great Lakes and Northeast. A reinforcing blast of 
arctic air will enter interior New England on Friday afternoon, accompanied 
by snow showers which will coat the ground in some areas. Ample sunshine 
will occur in the coastal areas of southern New England and the Middle 
Atlantic, though temperatures will remain 5 to 10 degrees below average. 
The southern Atlantic seaboard, including Florida, will be mainly 
sunny and seasonable. Some snow will fall in the central and southern 
Rockies while much of the Intermountain region experiences breaking 
clouds and seasonal temperatures. The Pacific Northwest will be dry 
as an upper-level ridge of high pressure develops over the area. California 
will be mainly sunny and dry with mild temperatures in the south. 
Focus: Warm Memories The calendar year 1998 was a year of warm memories. 
The average temperature across the earth's surface was the highest 
measured since records began in the mid-19th century. Each of the 
first 10 months of the year was warmer than any previous such month 
on record. An important contribution to the record-setting temperatures 
was El Nino, an anomalous warming of the equatorial eastern Pacific 
Ocean which reached its peak in March. Although El Nino faded by early 
summer, the warmth it had transferred to the atmosphere lingered for 
much of the year.
