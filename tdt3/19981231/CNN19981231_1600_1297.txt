The steelers are looking for a coach. I'm Anthony Keith James, and 
this is "CNN Headline Sports." After coming under fire during the 
team's first nonplayoff season in years, steelers' offensive coordinator 
Ray Sherman resigned today. Sherman joined the team in February after 
three years as the quarterbacks coach for the Vikings. Head coach 
Bill cowher says he had not planned to make any hasty decisions about 
Sherman. But a change was necessary, and both he and Sherman agreed 
that there was no reason to delay it.
