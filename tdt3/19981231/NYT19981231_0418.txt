With the biggest, loudest crowd in years herded neatly into barricaded 
quadrangles, New Year's Eve descended on Times Square on Thursday 
night in a carefully controlled explosion of festivity that felt like 
both a gala and a warm-up. An expected crowd of half a million, held 
in check by more than 5,000 police officers, gathered in midtown to 
watch the big aluminum ball make its final trip down the big aluminum 
pole. The ball will be replaced by a fancier crystal creation at next 
year's millennial extravaganza. There were, as there have been every 
Dec. 31 for decades, the crowds of tourists seemingly inured against 
the cold by the dazzle and the glitter, and the local folks drawn 
by the spectacle or unable to afford the high cover charges of the 
nightclubs. But there were also many merely caught in the chaos, struggling 
to get to restaurants and theaters as police officers checked ticket 
stubs and reservation letters, looking liked armed ushers and maitres 
d'hotel. If it was easier for the average reveler to see and hear 
what was going on this year than in recent years, it was only because 
of the new video screens and speakers installed as far as eight blocks 
away from the puppet shows and fireworks at the heart of the action. 
Some people said they had come this year because they did not stand 
a chance of getting a front-row seat for New Year's Eve 1999. ``Next 
year it's going to be really insane, so we thought we'd come this 
year,'' said Joshua Fifer, 18, an Americorps volunteer who made the 
trip from Washington with his girlfriend and staked out a spot on 
Broadway at 44th Street at 3 p.m. ``Next year, it's going to be a 
tough choice. We're worried about the terrorism. But I'll probably 
be stupid enough to come.'' And for those unable to get to the center 
of the action _ probably a vast majority this year _ the show of police 
force was as impressive as anything else. ``We can't get through because 
of the barriers, but I'm very impressed with the police,'' said Gaudin 
Wilfrid, a school bus driver in his 20s from Nantes, France, on vacation 
with his girlfriend. ``I've only seen this many at a student strike 
in Paris.'' Some people in Times Square had actually been drawn there 
by the promise of a display of state-of-the-art crowd control, like 
Damien Villa, a 15-year-old who said he plans to go into law enforcement 
and drove with his father from Gaffney, S.C. ``My wife said: `He's 
only 15; do you want to take him out in an environment like that?''' 
the boy's father, Jerry Villa, said. ``I said: `Look, he's had two 
years of karate, he's interested in criminal law, maybe in becoming 
a police officer and then a lawyer. This would be a good place to 
see how they do it.''' As Damien was asking one officer how he kept 
his cool in the midst of chaos, the officer demonstrated by politely 
defusing a woman who likened the police to Nazis. ``His response was 
great,'' Villa said. ``He said, `Thank you, I appreciate it, happy 
New Year.' And she went off even more, but he didn't lose it for a 
minute.'' When disorder broke out, it was quickly quelled. About 7:30 
p.m., two vendors illegally selling party favors and plastic hats 
had a confrontation at 45th Street and Eighth Avenue. Three seconds 
after shouts of ``Yo! yo! yo!'' flew back and forth, four helmeted 
police officers at the barricades nearby converged and broke things 
up. Even most people who were inconvenienced took the gantlet in stride 
_ though striding was out of the question. ``We had to crawl under 
a couple of barricades,'' said Irv Birnbaum, 47, a medical technician 
from Baltimore who had come to see the musical ``Chicago'' at the 
Shubert Theater on 44th Street. ``We got dirty. My wife is recovering 
from knee surgery; we knew it would be bad. But the police were polite. 
We knew it would be bad.'' But some people did not think it would 
be so bad. Maryanne and George Klein and their daughter Alexis, former 
New Yorkers transplanted to Greenville, N.C., had tickets to ``Phantom 
of the Opera,'' and they had to pick them up at the box office. ``We 
worked our way across 44th Street, but at each block we had to explain 
where we were going,'' said an exasperated Mrs. Klein. ``We were frustrated. 
We just didn't expect this to be that much of a problem.'' Even though 
they were already in the neighborhood, they said they had no plans 
to stick around after the show. ``We've had enough Times Square already,'' 
she said. ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience and we're not 
going to do it next year.''
