A rift is developing among congressional republicans over president 
clinton's Senate trial. Senate republican and democratic leaders are

from office, which could short-circuit a trial. House Judiciary chairman 
Henry Hyde, though, is urging Senate majority leader Trent Lott to 
hold a full-fledged trial, including testimony from witnesses.
