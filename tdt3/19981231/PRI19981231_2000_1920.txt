The discovery that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing 
speed has been named scientific breakthrough of the year by the journal 
Science. Rival teams in America and Britain are sharing the honor. 
The World's David Lavelli reports. The distant light of super novae 
or exploding stars provided the clues for British and American scientific 
teams to reach this conclusion: the universe is expanding at an accelerating 
rate. That discovery, hailed by the journal Science as the breakthrough 
of the year, means the universe will never end. Instead of a collapsing 
universe in which gravity would eventually pull all matter together 
in a final resounding crunch, the expansion models suggest that stars 
will move apart of eternity becoming cold and dusty. The idea of an 
endless, infinite cosmos has long intrigued philosophers, but now 
astro-physicists have a new problem on their hands, namely what force 
is driving the expansion. For The World, I'm David Lavelli.
