When the choice came down on this bright cool day to golf or heartfelt 
indoor gab, President Clinton, who has not had much recreation lately, 
made his preference clear. On his 15th visit to the annual Renaissance 
Weekend retreat, he spent almost six hours on the golf course and 
about 90 minutes, after dark, answering questions about subjects like 
the euro and biological warfare and voter turnout, with guests 13 
to 25 years old. All seminars held during Renaissance Weekend are 
off the record, and reporters were not admitted to Clinton's session 
Thursday evening. But a White House spokeswoman, Amy Weiss, said the 
subject of impeachment never came up. She said the final questioner 
in the audience of about 125 people asked Clinton what he had learned 
about life. She said he replied that ``he's more optimistic than when 
he took office in 1993, about the capacity of the American people 
to make changes and the ability of the government to help people improve 
their lives.'' In all, some 365 seminars are being held by the businessmen, 
politicians, journalists, academics and others who have assembled 
for five days of highbrow chatter and aggressive networking beside 
the Atlantic. So far, Clinton has skipped all the planned sessions, 
on matters from searching the soul to fattening the portfolio; he 
had suggested the one he led Thursday evening. Later, he and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton attended a banquet to mark the new year with the other 
guests. The president's travails in 1998 have not dampened turnout 
here. About 1,350 guests attended, more than in recent years, said 
Linda LeSourd Lader, one of the retreat's founders. Less certain is 
whether Clinton's difficulties have lent a certain frisson to the 
gathering, even more than his mere presence traditionally has. It 
is part of the ethic of Renaissance Weekend for guests to be blase 
about celebrities in their midst (since part of the satisfaction of 
attending is that everyone is supposed to be distinguished). Nevertheless, 
once Clinton arrived Thursday evening, some guests far older than 
25 could be seen scurrying through the halls of the Hyatt Hotel in 
the direction of his seminar. Passers-by eagerly greeted Clinton after 
he arrived Wednesday evening, when he took a stroll with his dog, 
Buddy, along the beach. Hillary Rodham Clinton took her own long walk 
on the beach Thursday. She spent most of the day, with her daughter, 
Chelsea, in the beachfront home that the family is renting from an 
Atlanta commodities trader. Ned Powell, one of five men who played 
golf with the president, said before the banquet Thursday evening 
that Clinton had clearly enjoyed himself. ``The people we saw along 
the golf course were very supportive,'' he said. Powell, the assistant 
secretary for management at the Department of Veterans Affairs, said 
it bothered him ``when people say, how can he take six hours to play 
golf?'' He called the time spent talking and joking on the course 
_ and sometimes taking a couple of extra drives when the first was 
unsatisfactory _ ``pure relaxation'' and ``a way to get away from 
the foolishness.''
