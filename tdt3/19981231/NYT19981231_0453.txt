All the other college bowls succumbed first, to the likes of Fedex, 
Nokia, USF&AMP;G, Jeep, CompUSA, Tostitos, Carquest, Chick-fil-A, 
Culligan, Toyota and Insight.com. But the Rose Bowl seemed immune 
to having a corporate name attached to it, playing the role of the 
anti-Poulan Weed Eater Independence Bowl. Not anymore. As viewers 
will see at 4:30 p.m. Friday, the good old Rose Bowl is now the Rose 
Bowl Presented by AT&AMP;T. AT&AMP;T affixed itself to the Rose Bowl 
as part of ABC's seven-year, $500 million deal to carry the four Bowl 
Championship Series games. For the last few years, ABC carried only 
the Rose and Sugar Bowls and CBS the Fiesta and Orange. But with ABC's 
money came the right to market sponsorships for the bowls. And only 
the Rose lacked a sponsor. ``We didn't have a lot of choice,'' said 
Jack French, the Rose Bowl's chief executive officer. ``The requirement 
was to let a sponsor put up the money to raise payouts to the teams 
by 30 or 40 percent.'' French said that joining the legion of the 
sponsored is the cost of doing business these days. ``If you don't 
make dust, you eat dust,'' he said. Last year, the Rose Bowl payouts 
to Michigan and Washington State, and their conferences, the Big 10 
and Pacific 10, totaled $18.5 million. This year, UCLA, Wisconsin 
and their conferences will share $24.8 million, a 34 percent increase. 
Mark Mandel, a spokesman for ABC Sports, said: ``We wanted to tread 
lightly and while we had the right to pick a sponsor, in reality, 
we wouldn't choose a sponsor without the Rose Bowl's agreement. We 
were on the same page.'' AT&AMP;T is paying an estimated $9.5 million 
for its sponsorship fee and commitment to buy commercial time, said 
Lesa Ukman, editor of IEG Sponsorship Report, a Chicago-based publication. 
The sum is similar to what Nokia, Tostitos and Fedex are paying for 
the Sugar, Fiesta and Orange Bowls, although AT&AMP;T does not have 
a title sponsorship. ``AT&AMP;T is being treated like a title sponsor, 
even though they're only the presenting sponsor, because they're borrowing 
the prestige of the Rose Bowl,'' Ukman said. An unusual feature of 
the sponsorship will be the absence of AT&AMP;T's name or logo on 
the Rose Bowl field. But French said electronic insertion technology 
will place AT&AMP;T icons on the field, which will be visible to viewers, 
not the spectators. ``This is being done very tastefully,'' French 
said about AT&AMP;T's involvement. ``It's different enough from title 
sponsorships because we kept our name first.'' But in 1996, the Hall 
of Fame Bowl saw its name replaced by a sponsor's, the Outback Steakhouse 
restaurant chain, when the game was renamed the Outback Bowl. Unlike 
AT&AMP;T, Outback will have its name on the field and on signs in 
Houlihan's Stadium in Tampa, Fla. The game, between Penn State and 
Kentucky, will be played Friday at 11 a.m. ``The College Hall of Fame 
was disappointed to lose its name on the game, but this is a big business,'' 
said Jim McVay, executive director of the Outback Bowl. ``Schools 
demand more dollars and you have to find the money.'' Cash from Outback 
helps provide about $2 million each for Penn State, Kentucky, and 
the Big 10 and Southeastern Conferences. McVay is more than happy 
to be with a second-tier bowl with a solid matchup, especially with 
attention focused on the Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch, a prospective 
No. 1 pro draft pick. And Outback _ renowned for sponsoring John Madden's 
bus _ is happy to reinforce its college sports spending with a bowl 
game in its hometown. ``College sports affect our loyalty and bonding 
with consumers,'' said Nancy Schneid, Outback's vice president for 
marketing. The Rose and Outback bowls are two of 23 bowls in a gridiron 
orgy that began Dec. 19 with the Las Vegas Bowl and will end Monday 
night with the Fiesta. Yes, it seems like a glut, and we would surely 
survive without half of them, but somebody's watching. About 1.1 million 
households tuned in to the Dec. 23 Ford Motor City Bowl and 3.7 million 
watched Purdue upset Kansas State in the Builders Square Alamo Bowl. 
Ratings tend to be a function of matchups, timing or competitive games. 
The Motor City Bowl's rating fell 63 percent, the Insight.com Bowl 
jumped 29 percent, and the Alamo Bowl rose 26 percent. A blowout in 
the Micron PC Bowl (formerly the Blockbuster Bowl, formerly the Carquest 
Bowl) caused a 32 percent ratings drop. Will the BCS' decision to 
create an annual matchup of the two top-ranked teams cause viewers 
to forsake the other three top bowls? The Rose has done well whether 
or not its outcome affected national rankings. But the Sugar, Orange 
and Fiesta Bowl ratings have gyrated, depending on their broader significance. 
The Fiesta's Tennessee-Florida State game should do very well this 
year because this is its turn in the four-game rotation to play host 
to the national championship. But will the other games matter to viewers? 
``The bowls put together matchups that make sense,'' Mandel said. 
``It's like a rock concert where the finale is the high point but 
the songs until then are pretty good, too.''
