Italian ski legend Alberto Tomba has closed out his amazing career 
in an emotional race in front of his home fans at Cestriair. Tomba, 
the first skier to win medals in three different Olympics, placed 
third in a short three-run giant slalom exhibition race under the 
flood lights Wednesday. Tomba clocked the fastest time in the first 
run but fell 12/100ths of a second behind Swiss winner Paul Acola. 
Patrick Holzer came in second. Tomba won the first of his 50 World 
Cup races at Cestriair in 1987. He competed in his last World Cup 
slalom last March, capping his 15-year career with a victory.
