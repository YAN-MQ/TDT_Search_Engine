Indonesian President B.J. Habibie on Thursday assured citizens of 
the recession-hit Southeast Asian nation that his government will 
work hard in the new year to fight corruption and promote reform. 
``We will continue with efforts to create a clean, respectable and 
capable government which is free from corruption, collusion and nepotism,'' 
Habibie said in a year-end speech. He also expressed hope for an improvement 
in areas such as human rights. Habibie came to power in May after 
his one-time mentor, ex-President Suharto, resigned amid widespread 
protests against his 32-year authoritarian rule. In a speech broadcasted 
nationwide by all radio and television stations, the new Indonesian 
president reiterated a pledge to bring about widescale political and 
economic reform. Habibie said a Parliamentary election scheduled for 
June 7 would usher in a new era of democratic rule. ``There is no 
intention from the government to maintain political status-quo because 
all will be decided by the democracy mechanism in accordance with 
the principles of people's sovereignty adopted by the 1945 constitution.'' 
He called on Indonesians to remain optimistic about their country's 
prospects in 1999 despite recent economic and social turmoil.
