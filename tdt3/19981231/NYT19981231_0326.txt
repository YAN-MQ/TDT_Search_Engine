A man with a crumpled brown fedora picked through the yak hoofs that 
lay on a roadside table, next to the slabs of fresh red yak meat. 
The man, whose name was Gomchen, seemed to be looking for something 
he could not find. ``Are these all you have?'' Gomchen asked, pushing 
up his hat and rubbing his forehead, as though the fedora were one 
size too small. The meat seller, Lobsang, was eager to make a sale 
on a slow day, but he seemed to grow impatient with the way Gomchen 
kept picking up the same hoofs, inspecting them and setting them back 
down. ``Are you buying or looking?'' Lobsang, who like many Tibetans 
uses only one name, asked between swats at the flies that buzzed around 
the hunks of yak meat on his tabletop. ``A hoof is a hoof.'' Gomchen 
wandered off without a word to inspect the wares at neighboring tables, 
where other meat sellers lounged patiently, each with a makeshift 
canopy to shield his meat from the afternoon sun. It was just another 
day at the yak meat market. Tibet may be known around the world as 
a mountainous region where a devoutly religious people have been persecuted 
by their Chinese landlords, but everyone has to eat. In Tibet, shopping 
for food inevitably includes a trip to the yak meat market. ``Yak, 
tsampa, tea,'' Lobsang said, describing his diet with a simplicity 
befitting this simple mountainous land. Tsampa is the main staple 
in Tibet, a mix of barley flour and rancid yak butter that tastes 
like flour with a little liquid butter added. Though most Tibetans 
are strict Buddhists, vegetarians are not as common here as in some 
other Buddhist regions. Yak meat is consumed in stew, in grilled hunks, 
and even _ particularly in restaurants frequented by tourists _ in 
yak burgers. The main restaurant in the Lhasa Hotel is called the 
Hard Yak Cafe. On this day, the meat market was moving at Tibetan 
speed, meaning things were slow. A few customers wandered up as the 
hours stretched by, but many resembled Gomchen, minus the fedora, 
since they looked more than they bought. A monk wearing an intricately 
woven gold-and-crimson cap and oversized sunglasses, his arms invisible 
under a full-length red robe, wandered from table to table, looking 
at the yak meat in silence. ``Business is bad,'' said Lhamo, whose 
red brocade headdress is the signature of Khampas, or people from 
Kham, a region in eastern Tibet. ``Too many sellers, not enough buyers.'' 
A rough winter of 1997-98 was followed by serious flooding in the 
summer. Though that might have set off a meat shortage, and driven 
prices up, yak meat sellers said it scared many Tibetan herders into 
thinking about what would happen if there was another rough winter 
this season. So an unusually large number of them decided to slaughter 
their yaks in the fall and cart the meat to Lhasa, Tibet's capital, 
where prices are traditionally the highest. With so much supply, however, 
the price of yak meat has fallen to 75 cents a pound, roughly half 
what it was two years ago. Chinese officials in Tibet boast that there 
are 1.5 million yaks here now, up from roughly 600,000 in 1959, when 
Beijing assumed full control over the region, as if that showed how 
beneficial Chinese rule has been. But statistics are questionable 
in an area as remote and inaccessible as Tibet, where 95 percent of 
the population are herdsman and farmers. It took Lobsang six days 
to haul his slaughtered yak from Kham to Lhasa in the back of a truck. 
The truckless sellers ride a yak to market and kill it after arrival. 
Tibetans often use yak hair for clothing and carpets, and make shoes, 
coats and boats out of the skin, and fashion decorations and utensils 
out of the horns. The dung is dried for fuel. But it was yak hoofs 
that interested Gomchen. Not that he would say why. G Yak hoofs could 
be had for a quarter apiece, the seller said over and over. Instead, 
Gomchen picked up several hoofs, inspecting each one closely, before 
putting it back on the table. ``Are these all you have?'' he asked 
again, as if this yak-meat seller might be hoarding more hoofs. But 
no, the seller said, ``What you see is what we have.''
