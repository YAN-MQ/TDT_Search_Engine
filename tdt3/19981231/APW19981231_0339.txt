Finance ministers from 11 European Union nations agreed Thursday on 
the irreversible rates at which their currencies will be locked together 
to form the new single currency known as the euro. The new common 
currency will be worth 1.95583 German marks, 6.55957 French francs, 
1936.27 Italian lire, 166.386 Spanish pesetas. The rates mean the 
euro will start trading at about dlrs 1.1665 when markets open Monday 
after the long New Year's weekend.
