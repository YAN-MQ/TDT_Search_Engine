Now a look back at the "fleecing of America." In 1998, "NBC nightly 
news" broadcast 66 "fleecing" reports, examples of fraud, waste or 
at least questionable spending. Four of them deserve special mention 
as this year comes to a close. No matter how you look at it, it's 
still an outhouse, at the Delaware water gap national park in Pennsylvania. 
At first, the national parks service said it cost taxpayers $330,000, 
but when all the bills came in this April, the final cost had more 
than doubled, to $770,000.
