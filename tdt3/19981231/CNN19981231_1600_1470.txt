This is Ron tank with the "Hollywood Minute." "Monday night football" 
has been thrown for a loss again. The ratings for this year's late-night 
game were the lowest in the show's 29-year history, 8% less than the 
previous low, last year. ABC points out the show was still the network's 
fifth most-watched prime-time program.
