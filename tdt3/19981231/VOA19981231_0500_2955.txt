Asian stock markets mixed with some markets responding to Wall Street's 
rise Tuesday in the year-end window dressing as others moving lower 
on the domestic issues. Tokyo, the region's biggest market, ended 
the year mixed in a shorter trading session Wednesday dominated by 
the uncertain political situation and a drop of bond prices. The Nikkei 
Index fell 4.73 points to end the year at 13,842. Advancing issues 
outpaced decliners, while 991 shares were unchanged. Hong Kong, the 
Hang Seng Index finished one percent lower in lackluster trading and 
position squaring ahead of the year-end holidays. The Hang Seng Index 
closed out the year down 104-1/2 points to 10,121. Australian stocks 
rose over one percent, bringing its 1998 gain to 7-1/2 percent, closing 
at 2,813.
