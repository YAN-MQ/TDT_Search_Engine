Bell Atlantic, the nation's largest local telephone company, is in 
talks to buy Airtouch Communications, the largest wireless telephone 
company for $45 billion in stock, executives close to the companies 
said Thursday night. The deal, which could be announced as early as 
Monday, would bring New York-based Bell Atlantic, which already offers 
cellular services along the East Coast, one step closer to creating 
a nationwide and even international wireless network. Airtouch serves 
the entire West Coast and has a number of partnerships in Europe and 
Asia that would expand Bell Atlantic's network considerably on those 
continents. Among those is a partnership with Mannesmann Mobilfunk 
of Germany that makes Airtouch one of the biggest providers of cellular 
services in Europe. In all, international wireless services make up 
57 percent of Airtouch's operating income, according to Deutsche Bank 
Research. As with any deal not yet sealed, talks could fall apart 
at any time. Both boards are expected to meet over the weekend to 
discuss details. Any deal would also need the blessing of GTE, which 
agreed last summer to be acquired by Bell Atlantic in a $52.9 billion 
stock swap. At the time, GTE shareholders complained that Bell Atlantic 
did not pay a premium for their shares as is typical in large stock 
acquisitions. But as of Thursday night, GTE executives were said to 
be supportive of the deal, believing it would be good for the combined 
companies. Analysts said Thursday that if a deal is reached, the prices 
of some cellular calls on the newly combined network could be sliced 
by more than 50 percent. ``With all the increased competition in the 
industry, rates have been falling around 15 percent to 20 percent 
annually in wireless,'' said Mel Marten, an analyst with Edward Jones. 
``If this acquisition doesn't accelerate that amount, it should definitely 
keep it continuing.'' And beyond lower prices, analysts said that 
the main impetus for combining cellular networks was the ongoing effort 
within the industry to offer service plans that can be used anywhere 
in the United States. Last year, AT&AMP;T introduced its Digital One 
rate service, which lets users buy 600 wireless minutes at $90 a month 
that can be used anywhere in the country. Sprint PCS has introduced 
similar plans. A Bell Atlantic and AirTouch combination, analysts 
said, would be well positioned to compete against both plans. Based 
on the closing stock price Thursday, Bell Atlantic has a market value 
of $87 billion, twice that of AirTouch, which is valued at $41.4 billion. 
``This deal makes all the sense in the world,'' said Charles A. Morris, 
manager of the T. Rowe Price Science and Technology Fund, which owns 
AirTouch stock. ``This allows them to have a national footprint and 
compete with AT&AMP;T and Sprint PCS.'' Still, any combination of 
the two companies faces hurdles among both regulators and investors. 
For one thing, the merger between GTE and Bell Atlantic, which is 
currently under scrutiny by the federal government, has not yet been 
completed. Adding another party to that merger could raise even more 
eyebrows in Washington, even though some industry observers suggest 
a Bell Atlantic and AirTouch combination is likely to be completed 
first.
