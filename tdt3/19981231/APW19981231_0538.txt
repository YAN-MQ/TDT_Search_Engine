Montenegro's reformist leader warned Slobodan Milosevic on Thursday 
not to try to impose his rule in the republic by force, saying the 
Yugoslav president would ``end up the loser.'' President Milo Djukanovic, 
whose republic forms Yugoslavia together with much bigger Serbia, 
is an opponent of Milosevic, currently the president of the joint 
federation. A clash between the two over a number of issues has led 
to political tension. There are fears Milosevic could try to strengthen 
his grip over Montenegro by installing his proteges in power there. 
Djukanovic last year won an election against a Milosevic aide, but 
the Yugoslav president refused to recognize the victory. Further fueling 
the tensions, Milosevic named his Montenegrin aide Momir Bulatovic 
premier of Yugoslavia, ignoring the legitimate leadership of Montenegro. 
He recently replaced army and state security chiefs who had good ties 
with Djukanovic. Bulatovic and his followers held violent protests 
in the capital Podgorica last January when dozens of people were injured 
in clashes with the police. Another rally is planned for this January. 
Djukanovic said ``attempts to discipline Montenegro by force, or put 
it back under the unchallenged, autocratic rule of one man are unimaginable.'' 
The Montenegrin leader, who enjoys American support, accused Milosevic 
of ``inciting conflicts,'' but added the Serb strongman ``would end 
up the loser if he clashes with Montenegro.'' Milosevic, who became 
president of Serbia in 1990, is considered chiefly responsible for 
the breakup of former Yugoslavia which led to the Croatian and Bosnian 
wars. The Montenegrin leadership fears a similar scenario there. But 
Djukanovic said ``I believe that ... we have protected Montenegro 
more than effectively against a new destruction by Milosevic.'' Analysts 
believe the political crisis could lead to a breakup of what remains 
of Yugoslavia. Djukanovic warned that Montenegro would ignore decisions 
by the federal government it considers illegitimate.
