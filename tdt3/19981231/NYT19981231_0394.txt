Robert S. Johnson, an 8th Air Force fighter pilot who shot down 27 
German planes in an 11-month span during World War II and then came 
home to a hero's welcome from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, died 
on Sunday at St. Francis Hospital in Tulsa, Okla. He was 78 and was 
the second-leading American air ace of the war in Europe. Johnson, 
who lived in Lake Wylie, S.C., was hospitalized on Dec. 24 after collapsing 
while on a visit with relatives, according to a niece, Margaret Sue 
Roth. The cause of death was not immediately known. Protecting Flying 
Fortress bombers on their missions deep into Germany in his barrel-nosed 
P-47 Thunderbolt fighters, Johnson was the second World War II fighter 
pilot to break the U.S. record of 26 air ``victories'' set by Capt. 
Eddie Rickenbacker in World War I. He accomplished that feat when 
he knocked down two Luftwaffe fighters near Brunswick, Germany, on 
May 8, 1944, on his final mission. His squadron commander in the 56th 
Fighter Group, Lt. Col. Francis Gabreski, was the only U.S. fighter 
pilot in Europe with more ``kills,'' having shot down 28 German planes 
and destroyed three more on the ground. Major Richard Bong of the 
Army Air Forces, the first pilot to break Rickenbacker's mark, was 
the leading American ace of the entire war, downing 40 Japanese planes. 
On June 6, 1944, _ the date of the D-Day invasion _ Johnson was flown 
back to the United States for a new mission: selling war bonds, exhorting 
factory workers to greater feats of production and bucking up homefront 
morale in the face of heavy air-war casualties. Gabreski would recall 
how Johnson had ``phenomenal eyesight.'' ``There were some guys who 
just seemed to have an uncanny knack for seeing things before anyone 
else did,'' Gabreski wrote in his memoir ``Gabby'' (Orion, 1991). 
``His eyes were very keenly tuned to the sky. If he looked into a 
certain area, and enemy aircraft were there, he saw them ahead of 
the rest of us.'' Robert Samuel Johnson, who was born in Lawton, Okla., 
became fascinated by planes as an 8-year-old the day he perched on 
his father's shoulders at Post Field near Lawton and watched three 
World War I fighters perform stunts. ``Then and there I changed my 
goal from cowboy or railroad engineer to Army aviator,'' he remembered. 
He started flying at age 13, got his first license the day before 
he turned 16, and after attending junior college at what is now Cameron 
University in Lawton, entered an Army aviation school on Nov. 11, 
1941. He scored his first ``kill'' on June 13, 1943, when he broke 
from formation to go after a Focke-Wulf fighter, something that was 
decidedly against the book then. That foray brought a bawling out 
from his superiors, and Johnson would recall that he ``had a reputation 
as a sort of wild man.'' ``Other pilots would say, `Don't fly with 
Johnson, he'll get you killed,''' he recalled in an interview with 
Military History magazine in 1996. But he was awarded the Distinguished 
Service Cross, the Silver Star and the Distinguished Flying Cross 
with the 56th Fighter Group, the renowned Zemke's Wolfpack. Named 
for its commander, Col. Hubert Zemke, the Wolfpack boasted five of 
the top 10 American air aces in Europe. Johnson was never shot down, 
but had a harrowing experience on June 26, 1943, when the pilot of 
a Focke-Wulf 190 fighter fired 21 cannon shells into the fuselage 
of his Thunderbolt during a mission over France. Burned and momentarily 
blinded by splashing hydraulic fuel and slightly wounded in the right 
leg and his nose, he tried to bail out but could not open his shattered 
canopy. He headed back to England, but another Focke-Wulf riddled 
his plane with small-arms fire over the English Channel. That pilot 
finally ran out of ammunition, pulled alongside, wiggled his wings 
in tribute and peeled off as the crippled Thunderbolt continued to 
England. When he returned to the United States in June 1944, Johnson 
was reunited with his wife, Barbara, and they were greeted by Roosevelt 
at the White House. Later that day, he received a standing ovation 
from members of the U.S. Senate when he appeared with his wife in 
the visitors' gallery, and the couple had tea with Mrs. Roosevelt 
at the White House afterward. The next day, he received the applause 
of thousands of aircraft workers when he visited the plant of Republic 
Aviation, which built the Thunderbolt, in Farmingdale, N.Y. After 
the war, Johnson was a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force reserves 
and recounted his combat experiences in ``Thunderbolt!'' (Rinehart, 
1958). He was an executive with Republic Aviation for 18 years, and 
then worked in the insurance industry. Johnson's wife died in 1995. 
He had no immediate survivors. Remembering his fighter-pilot days, 
Johnson once observed: ``I'm a fatalist, a strong believer that when 
your time is up, you're gone, out of here. Why worry about that?'' 
But he added: ``I was always scared _ that was what made me move quick.''
