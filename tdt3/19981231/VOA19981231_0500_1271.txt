Hope is rapidly dimming to salvage the National Basketball Association 
season with a league imposed deadline to end the labor disagreement 
just one week away. Some of the more prominent NBA stars like David 
Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs are wondering out loud why a deal 
can't be reached. When I look at the things surrounding the NBA and 
the success that we've had as a league, I'm lost with their logic. 
But, you know, players understand. We're going to take a step backwards 
and our salaries are going to get cut. The question is, you know, 
how much? I mean, I think that, you know, both sides just need to 
be reasonable as far as how far back we're going to go. NBA Commissioner 
David Stern has offered what he describes as the league's final offer, 
but players union head Billy Hunter says the proposal falls short 
of what the players are seeking. Stern is expected on January 7th 
to ask the league's Board of Governors for permission to scrap the 
rest of the scheduled season. So far, the six-month old labor dispute 
has wiped out hundreds of games and cost NBA players millions of dollars 
in salary.
