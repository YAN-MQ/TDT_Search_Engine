Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has ordered the builders of the Three Gorges 
dam to ensure that the huge hydroelectric project does not result 
in a disaster due to poor engineering, state-run media reported Thursday. 
``The responsibility on your shoulders is heavier than a mountain. 
Any carelessness or negligence will bring disaster to our future generations 
and cause irretrievable losses,'' Zhu said while recently touring 
the construction site along the Yangtze River, in central China. Zhu's 
remarks, printed by the state-run Xinhua News Agency and major newspapers, 
were the first explicit official expression of concern about the project, 
whose critics say it will cause massive environmental damage while 
doing little to control flooding along the volatile river. When necessary, 
China plans to invite top international engineering companies to inspect 
the dam and monitor the quality of its construction, the reports cited 
Zhu as saying. ``A strict engineering quality monitoring system must 
be introduced into the Three Gorges Project,'' he said. The dlrs 25 
billion dam, east of the central city of Chongqing, is intended to 
control flooding along the Yangtze and supply much needed power for 
economic development. Reports by experts who have toured the region 
say the endeavor has been plagued by widespread popular resistance 
and corruption. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, 
brushed off suggestions that China's decision to have international 
inspection of the dam was a vote of no confidence in its own inspectors. 
``There is a certain difference between Chinese and international 
monitoring companies. We would like to adopt international standards 
in monitoring projects,'' he said. ``I think this is a good thing.'' 
Earlier this week, the government launched a campaign to emphasize 
better quality construction and curb rampant graft that has contributed 
to numerous building, road and bridge collapses. The drive is intended 
both to boost safety and to prevent waste and embezzlement of the 
billions of dollars China is devoting to construction of such basic 
infrastructure to help boost the economy. Premier Zhu also said there 
was a need to improve management of funds intended for the Three Gorges 
project and to ensure a successful relocation of the 1.2 million people 
who will be displaced by the dam. ``We must establish a strict auditing 
system and increase transparency in the use of funds to make sure 
that not a penny of project funds is misused or diverted,'' Xinhua 
quoted Zhu as saying. In a separate report, Xinhua said Thursday that 
construction had begun on a five-kilometer (3-mile) long bridge across 
the Yangtze, downriver from the Three Gorges project near the central 
city of Wuhan. The 1.3 billion yuan (dlrs 157 million) bridge will 
be a link in an expressway connecting Beijing in the north with Zhuhai 
in the south, it said.
