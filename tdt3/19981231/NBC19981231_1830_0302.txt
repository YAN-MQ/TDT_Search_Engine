Still ahead tonight -- what happens when the clock strikes midnight 
next year? Somewhere, someplace there will be people who will die 
as a result of the y2K problem. That's "in depth" tonight. What the 
military is doing to defuse what it calls the "millennium bomb." L 
right, all right. but there's one thing everybody in Washington can 
agree on. There's more heartburn than ever! That would be? And more 
republicans. More pain. and more burning, more pressure. Yeah, and 
it's time someone did more about it, too. Alka-seltzer does more, 
with more medicines than any antacid or acid blocker. Alka-seltzer 
speeds complete relief to your worst heartburn and pain. Yeah, alka-seltzer. 
This country deserves more. You sound like a democrat. Democrats just 
promise more. For itchy patches of dry winter skin, moisturizers can't 
always cut it. Try... among these, only cortizone 10 plus has 10 moisturizers, 
plus the power of cortizone 10 to stop itch and help heal. Try new 
cortizone 10 plus.
