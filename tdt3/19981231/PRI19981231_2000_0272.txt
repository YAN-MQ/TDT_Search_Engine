China's Prime Minister Geron Ge had a warning today for construction 
workers at the huge Three Gorges Dam on the Yankse River. He says 
any negligence on the job will bring disaster. The prime minister 
was speaking during a visit to the site which will be the largest 
hydro-electric project in the world. Carrie Gracy reports. The Three 
Gorges Dam is already controversial for other reason. More than a 
million people have been forced to leave their homes and many experts 
worry about environment damage and military vulnerability. It would 
be a terrible blow to government prestige if questions about engineering 
undermine confidence further. Geron Ge warned the dam builders that 
fund management must be improved to insure that not a penny as misused 
or diverted. And in a final loss of faith, he said foreign engineering 
companies should be brought in to monitor quality. Carrie Gracy, BBC, 
Beijing.
