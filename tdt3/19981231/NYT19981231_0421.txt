Less than a week before National Basketball Association owners convene 
to vote on whether to cancel the season, the players' union Thursday 
prepared a final proposal that included a major concession: putting 
a cap on players' salaries. Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, 
said that compromise _ and several others _ should persuade commissioner 
David Stern and the owners to renew talks before the league's Jan. 
7 deadline for scrapping the season. The lockout is in its 185th day. 
Even if an agreement were reached right now, the earliest the season 
could begin would be the last week of January, which would allow a 
maximum of 45-50 games. ``Let's face it, David and I are both in deep 
water right now,'' Hunter said Thursday night. ``The players have 
lost over $400 million in salaries, and the league is looking at even 
more financial ruin. It can't be about David Stern saving face right 
now. It has to be win, win for both of us. ``If he and I are going 
to get back to shore, we're going to have to bail each other out. 
Because I'll tell you right now: He ain't going back without me.'' 
The players, Hunter said, have proposed a $15 million cap for high-salaried 
players with more than 10 years experience. The union had proposed 
to cap players' salaries with fewer than than 10 years experience. 
Also, Hunter said, the union has lowered its revenue percentages in 
the final three years of any new deal, to 55 percent for the 2001-2 
season. The NBA's offer is at 53 percent for that season. Each percentage 
point represents $20 million, meaning they are $40 million apart on 
dividing about $2 billion a season in total revenue. Also, Hunter 
said, a backup tax on the escrow package that would be installed over 
the last three years of the six-year proposal has been accepted by 
the players. Hunter added that the proposal does not contain a change 
in the rookie wage scale. The players are still united in the notion 
of unlimited free agency after four years for a player, while the 
league has said it wants teams to have the fifth year at an option. 
``The relief we have given them is the relief they wanted on the high-end 
players,'' Hunter said Thursday night. ``We're less than $3 million 
apart on that issue and between $500,000 and $1 million on several 
other issues. You're going to tell me they're going to blow up the 
season with this much on the table?'' In their final offer last Wednesday, 
the owners proposed that no player could earn more than $12.25 million 
in the first year of a new deal. The league's office had not seen 
a copy of the players' proposal. In another legal skirmish, lawyers 
on each side could not agree on how the proposal would be exchanged. 
Jeffrey Kessler, chief outside counsel for the union, called Jeffrey 
Mishkin, the NBA's chief legal officer, to request a meeting at which 
the proposal would be presented. After Mishkin informed him that he 
would forward the proposal to the league's labor relations committee 
and that the owners would not agree to a meeting until they have viewed 
the proposal, Kessler called back to inform Mishkin he would not be 
forwarding the proposal, after all. ``He told me no one in the NBA 
may meet with us to receive the proposal and discuss it,'' Kessler 
said. ``We have to submit it in writing, they have to evaluate the 
proposal. If they thought it was good enough and it met their standards 
to have a meeting, they might meet with us. That's not how two sides 
who respect each other bargain. It's too late for parlor games. It's 
time to negotiate.'' Mishkin replied: ``He's overlooking the critical 
point. We made our final offer. They rejected it. Out of courtesy 
and respect, we will submit their final proposal. This isn't about 
playing games. We have a serious economic difference and this is no 
way to go about solving it. We're too far along.'' ``The proposal 
we have put out is not perfect for the players, but it's a compromise 
we're willing to make to reach a deal,'' Hunter said. The two sides 
last met last Sunday in Denver. Stern is due back in New York on Sunday 
while Hunter, who is spending New Year's in Philadelphia with family, 
is scheduled to return Saturday. Neither the league nor the union 
predicted a weekend meeting.
