SATURDAY GAMES: 12:30 p.m. _ Buffalo (10-6) vs. Miami (10-6) _ KEY 
STATS: Bills (87.4) _ Doug Flutie quarterback rating. Dolphins (80.0) 
_ Dan Marino quarterback rating. COMMENT: This is the third meeting 
this season between these divisional rivals, with Miami winning by 
13-7 at home and Buffalo winning by 30-24 at home. This one is in 
Miami's house, Pro Player Stadium, site of Super Bowl XXXIII. Miami 
is 7-1 at home, where it has allowed an average of only 10.3 points 
a game. These teams are so familiar that it will be difficult to pull 
punches or surprises. Both, however, will try. Watch Miami to try 
something funky in the kicking game. Look for Buffalo to razzle with 
a reverse or two or a halfback pass. But when you get right down to 
it, two factors will swing this game Buffalo's way: the running game 
and turnovers. The Bills boast the second-best rushing game in the 
American Football Conference (135.9 yards averaged a game) and are 
6-0 this season when back Antowain Smith scores a touchdown. In turnovers, 
Buffalo is plus 3 over Miami, and the Bills have lost only six fumbles, 
fewest in team history. Watch Buffalo kicker Steve Christie _ he has 
20 playoff field goals and needs 3 more to pass George Blanda for 
most in postseason history. Christie will get his kicks. So will Buffalo. 
BILLS, 23-17. 4:05 p.m. _ Arizona (9-7) vs. Dallas (10-6) _ KEY STATS: 
Cardinals (89) _ Frank Sanders NFC-best receptions total. Cowboys 
(32-19) _ playoff record. COMMENT _ No wonder Dallas has such a worldwide 
following. The Cowboys' .627 playoff winning percentage is second 
only to Green Bay's .710 (22-9 record). Dallas has more playoff seasons 
(25) than any other franchise, more games (51), more victories (32) 
and more points (1,254). It is a league-best 12-3 in the playoffs 
in the 1990s, and that includes a 7-0 home record. Do you hear the 
Arizona Cardinals knees knocking? No. Don't say poor Arizona. Don't 
pity the Cardinals. They are flying now, winning last week over San 
Diego in dramatic fashion to reach their first playoffs in 16 years. 
So, the Cardinals have not won a playoff game since 1947. So what. 
This is a special team. It won a league record seven games by 3 or 
fewer points. It has a quarterback in Jake Plummer who passed for 
3,737 yards, third-best in the National Football Conference. Receiver 
Frank Sanders made 31 third-down catches, second-best in the NFC. 
Safety Kwamie Lassiter earned an NFC-best eight interceptions, four 
of them last week in the San Diego game. The Cardinals dropped both 
games to Dallas in the regular season, and Dallas scored 38 the first 
time and 35 in the rematch. Arizona will need a solid game from end 
Simeon Rice to help spur its defense and slow down the Dallas scoring. 
Once that is accomplished, watch Plummer, who passed for 465 yards 
vs. Dallas in November, finish it. CARDINALS, 31-28. SUNDAY GAMES: 
12:40 p.m. _ New England (9-7) vs. Jacksonville (11-5) KEY STATS: 
Patriots (1,115) _ Rookie back Robert Edwards rushing yards. Jaguars 
(1,223) _ Rookie back Fred Taylor's rushing yards. COMMENT: Two rookie 
running backs square heads as two teams who played in the 1997 AFC 
championship game meet once again in the post-season. The running 
backs will gain attention but not nearly as much as the quarterbacks. 
Mark Brunell believes he can bounce back from injury for Jacksonville. 
Drew Bledsoe is out for New England. This is Jacksonville's first 
home playoff game in its history. Jacksonville has won 21 of its last 
24 at home and is 7-1 there this season. The battle is uphill all 
the way for New England and Scott Zolak, its starting quarterback. 
What gives New England a chance is a savvy group of veterans on defense 
who know how to perform well in big games. Linebacker Chris Slade, 
cornerback Ty Law and others along the defense have immense pride 
and talent to match, and they will make the game rugged for the Jacksonville 
offense, especially early. But without enough help from the depleted 
offense, the Patriots will suffer. New England's chances are better 
if Brunell couldn't go and rookie backup Jonathon Quinn played. That 
would be an equalizer. Jacksonville, though, slips by. JAGUARS, 16-14. 
4:15 p.m. _ Green Bay (11-5) vs. San Francisco (12-4) KEY STATS: Packers 
(4-0) _ Wild card playoff record. 49ers (17-1) _ Coach Steve Mariucci's 
home record. COMMENT: Five straight losses. Three straight playoff 
losses. Mind games. That's what the Packers have done to the 49ers: 
tossed them aside for five straight and put doubt and confusion and 
frustration into the 49ers' minds. In 18 home games, 49ers coach Steve 
Mariucci has lost only once. Guess to which team? Green Bay, of course. 
San Francisco is tired of it. They want the streak to end now. Watch 
Steve Young enter with precision and watch the 49ers play with a type 
of emotion we have seldom seen. This matchup will bring out their 
greatest passion. And, yet, it might not be enough. There are reasons 
why Green Bay has hammered the 49ers. First, they've physically hammered 
them. Then, too, quarterback Brett Favre has outplayed Young, and 
the Green Bay defense has thoroughly outplayed the 49ers' defense. 
The game will boil down to receiver Antonio Freeman against the 49ers' 
secondary. In the last two games between these teams, Freeman has 
11 catches for 300 yards and 3 touchdowns. There is no one back there 
to shut down Freeman. He is the thorn that will pierce San Francisco 
most. Once again. PACKERS, 28-21
