During the Rangers' unsettling 3-1 loss to the Coyotes in Phoenix 
on Wednesday night, it was easy to overlook Dan Cloutier, the rookie 
goaltender. Playing in the place of the first-stringer, Mike Richter, 
and making his first start since the night before Thanksgiving, Cloutier 
stopped 23 of 26 shots. His best efforts came in the first period, 
when the Rangers were overwhelmed but emerged with a 1-0 lead. Richter 
was expected in the nets Thursday night when the Rangers played the 
Colorado Avalanche in the third game of a four-game trip. But Patrick 
Roy, the star goalie of Colorado, was not expected to play because 
of a sprained left knee. Craig Billington was to play instead. After 
the game in Phoenix, Rangers Coach John Muckler harshly criticized 
his team for its lack of intensity after three days off. He spoke 
specifically of John MacLean failing to score on a breakaway, of Kevin 
Stevens missing an open net and of Todd Harvey turning over the puck, 
which helped create the final goal for the Coyotes, at the 12-minute 
mark of the third period. But Muckler had words of praise for Cloutier, 
who has made seven starts among his nine appearances and has a record 
of 2-3-2. ``He played real well,'' Muckler said. ``He gave us a chance 
to win. And we didn't do the job.'' Many of Cloutier's challenges 
were from close range against a Phoenix team playing without its top 
line of Jeremy Roenick, Keith Tkachuk and Dallas Drake. The first 
two are injured; Drake is under suspension. Despite the missing stars, 
the Coyotes cycled the puck in the Rangers' end and often seemed a 
step quicker and more aggressive than the visitors. Cloutier stopped 
Rick Tocchet from right in front a few times, although Tocchet later 
scored the winning goal on one of his five shots. ``I was ready mentally,'' 
Cloutier said. ``I played the way I am capable of playing. Obviously, 
I felt good.'' He is not lobbying for more work, although he would 
not turn it down. ``Obviously, you'd like to play every night,'' Cloutier 
said. ``You feel more comfortable when you play night in and night 
out. I think it's important for me to be well prepared because I don't 
know when I'm going to play. I take it one day at a time and tell 
myself, in my mind, `Maybe I will get a start soon. Just be ready.' 
``Obviously, we didn't have the results, but it's another game and 
more experience for me. Every time I get a chance to play, I'm pretty 
thrilled.'' Cloutier, 22, is 6 feet 1 inch and 192 pounds and a first-round 
choice from the 1994 draft. Because he is a top prospect with a growing 
reputation, Cloutier's name is often heard in trade rumors. The Rangers 
last summer signed Richter to a four-year contract for more than $5 
million a season. So, the theory goes, why not trade Cloutier in a 
package for a sharpshooting wing, one of the team's many shortcomings? 
Wednesday night's defeat was the third in four games for the Rangers, 
and the sixth in their last eight. Although the score was close, the 
domination by the Coyotes, particularly in the first period, was reminiscent 
of last season, when the Rangers seemed to lose their spirit and failed 
to make the playoffs for the first time since 1993. The loss in Arizona 
left them three games below .500 with the midseason mark just two 
weeks away. If the playoffs were to begin today, the Rangers would 
not qualify. They will finish the trip on Saturday night in St. Louis.
