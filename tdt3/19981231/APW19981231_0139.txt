Russian inflation, which appeared under control until a financial 
crisis hit last summer, reached 84 percent for all of 1998, the government 
said Thursday. With Russia still mired in crisis, many private economists 
expect the rate for 1999 to be as high, if not higher. In preparing 
the 1999 federal budget, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government 
has forecast inflation at 30 percent, but many analysts regard this 
as overly optimistic. Russia suffered from hyperinflation for several 
years after it moved to a market economy in 1992, but the government 
seemed to be taming inflation in recent years. The rate was 11 percent 
in 1997 and the government was expecting single-digit inflation for 
1998 until the financial crisis struck in August. Since then, the 
Russian currency has lost much of its value, the government has effectively 
defaulted on some of its debts and the economy has been in a nose 
dive. The economy contracted about 5 percent in 1998 and Russia remained 
trapped in one of the worst depressions ever experienced by an industrialized 
nation. Meanwhile, a Russian court has declared bankrupt what was 
one of the country's largest banks, clearing the way for the first 
liquidation of a major bank since the August crisis. The Moscow Arbitration 
Court ruled this week that Tokobank was bankrupt and that its assets 
should be distributed among creditors, The Moscow Times reported. 
The bank was once among the 20 largest in Russia, but now has debts 
of 7.5 billion rubles (dlrs 363 million) and assets of just 3.4 billion 
rubles (dlrs 165 million), the newspaper reported. Russia has some 
1,500 banks, but many have been hard hit by the financial crisis and 
have either closed or are providing only limited services. Government 
officials have said that perhaps only half of the country's banks 
will survive the crisis. The government's efforts to restructure and 
revive the banking system have moved slowly.
