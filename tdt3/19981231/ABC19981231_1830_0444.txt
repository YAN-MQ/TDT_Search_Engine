It'll feel like below zero in Times Square tonight, waiting for the 
big 1999 ball to descend. The warmup has already happened in many 
places around the world. In Sydney, sparkles in the night sky lit 
the world famous opera house, the $1.2 million display is just a taste 
of what the host city's preparing for the 2000 summer Olympic games. 
In central Tokyo, thousands gathered as a Buddhist monk struck a temple 
bell 108 times, a traditional way of dispelling the evils of the last 
year. Overhead, cosmonauts on the Russian space station Mir enjoyed 
just a sip of cognac, regulations say alcohol isn't supposed to be 
on board. On TV Boris Yeltsin told the rest of his countrymen, "what 
can I say? The year was difficult for the country, for many of you, 
and for me too." But no matter where you are tonight, there's extra 
time to celebrate. One second is being added to the world's super 
accurate atomic clocks to make up for very slight variance in the 
earth's rotation.
