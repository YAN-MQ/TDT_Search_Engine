Putting the worst of 1998 behind him, Brazilian striker Ronaldo says 
he is looking to regain his standing as the world's best player in 
1999. Ronaldo, speaking to an Italian newspaper from Brazil, said 
he was regaining his form and fitness and expects to play an integral 
role in the rest of the season for Inter Milan. ``I've been training 
like mad ... even more than I do in Italy. My knees are responding 
better and better to the exercise,'' he said in an interview Thursday 
in La Gazzetta dello Sport. Ronaldo thanked Inter for the extra two 
days' holiday it allowed him in Rio de Janeiro. ``It's been fundamentally 
important for my work, my physical well-being and my mind,'' he said. 
``Inter will not regret its decision. I'll do everything to make sure 
it won't regret it.'' Ronaldo, who has played sparingly this season 
due to recurring tendinitis in his knees, said his immediate aim is 
to get back to ``feeling 100 percent and therefore playing 100 percent 
... without feeling the least pain.'' Already, he said, he's succeeding 
in ``doing more and with less pain.'' Ronaldo felt plenty of pain 
in 1998 _ and so did his fans, who never got a clear explanation of 
the reason for his mysteriously poor performance in Brazil's 3-0 loss 
to France in the World Cup final. Ronaldo allegedly suffered convulsions 
before the match and was left off the initial lineup sheet. He went 
on to play, but made little impact, a surprising performance from 
a player twice voted best in the world by FIFA. The shame of that 
is eased by his upcoming recognition as the best overall player of 
France '98, an honor to be handed out Feb. 1 in Barcelona. ``It has 
made me forget how the World Cup ended,'' Ronaldo told the Italian 
newspaper. ``Fortunately, it's just a bad memory now.'' He spoke optimistically 
of the year ahead with Inter, even though the Milan team is currently 
behind Fiorentina in the Italian league standings. ``We have lots 
of time to win the championship,'' he said. Speaking of teammate Roberto 
Baggio, Ronaldo said, ``We've not played much together but now we'll 
be together to give our fans a good time. It's what people want, and 
what we want too.''
