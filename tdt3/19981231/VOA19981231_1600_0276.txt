Leaders of the U.S. Senate are considering a plan which would avoid 
a full trial of President Clinton and censure him instead. The leadership 
has reported to be considering calling a vote early in the process 
on whether the charges against the president are serious enough to 
result in his removal from office. If the decision is yes, the trial 
will proceed. If the senators decide the charges are not worthy, they 
would move to a debate on censure. Some Republicans, particular on 
the House Judiciary Committee sharply oppose the idea. Steven Hess 
of the Brookings Institution takes a dim view of that opposition. 
It strikes me that these folks are truly reaching. They had their 
opportunity. They apparently muffed it, and now they're trying to 
have a second crack at calling witnesses. The House of Representatives 
impeached Mr. Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice 
ten days go.
