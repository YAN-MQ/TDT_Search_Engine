British Petroleum has received U.S. approval to acquire the U.S.-based 
Amoco Corporation for $60 billion, removing the last major regulatory 
hurdle to the deal. The approval allows the two companies to close 
the transaction within a couple of days. The deal will create the 
world's second largest oil company behind Royal Dutch Shell and the 
largest U.S. gasoline retailer. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission 
cleared the way for BP to buy Amoco after the two companies agreed 
to sell 134 gasoline stations and several Amoco petroleum storage 
terminals.
