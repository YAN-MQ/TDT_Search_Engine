Slovakia's new government is interested in opening talks with NATO 
that will ultimately lead to alliance membership for the Central European 
nation, the foreign minister said Thursday. Eduard Kukan acknowledged 
to journalists that NATO is unlikely to invite new countries to begin 
accession talks at the April summit at which the Czech Republic, Hungary 
and Poland gain membership. But the foreign minister said he hopes 
for such talks in the nearest future, the Czech news agency CTK reported. 
Slovakia's chances of joining both NATO and the European Union improved 
significantly when September parliamentary elections resulted in a 
pro-Western government ousting that of authoritarian Vladimir Meciar. 
However, Defense Minister Pavol Kanis admitted that the new government 
has yet to stabilize the country's internal political situation _ 
a condition of NATO entry _ CTK reported. He said that despite a lack 
of financial resources, the Slovak army has kept high standards, and 
plans a reorganization next year.
