Starting Friday, 11 European countries will have a common currency: 
the euro. European Union finance ministers meet in Brussels today 
to set the euro's exchange rate against the national currencies of 
participating countries. The euro is expected to be initially worth 
about $1.18. The monetary union will formally go into effect at midnight 
Brussels time after a day of festivities. The euro's inauguration 
capped decades of work to harmonize the 11 countries' economic and 
monetary policies and to bring down trade barriers. The new currency 
will cover an area populated by more than 290 million people. The 
countries that have adopted the euro are Germany, France, Italy, Spain, 
the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia, Portugal, Finland, Ireland, and 
Luxembourg.
