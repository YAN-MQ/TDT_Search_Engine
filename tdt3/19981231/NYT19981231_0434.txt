The Nets' president, Michael Rowe, denied a report Thursday that stated 
that the Nets had made informal offers to buy the New Jersey Devils 
from the hockey team's owner, John McMullen. But Rowe said the Nets 
would be interested in acquiring the National Hockey League franchise 
if it were placed on the market. ``If the team was available for sale, 
would we be interested?'' Rowe asked. ``We likely would, but its nothing 
we've ever approached them about.'' An article in Thursday's editions 
of The Newark Star-Ledger reported that officials familiar with the 
relationship between the two teams said ``several informal offers'' 
had been made by the Nets, including one that called for an outright 
purchase of the club. But Rowe called it ``all speculation'' because 
the Devils are not yet for sale. ``To my knowledge, there's never 
been an offer made to the Devils,'' said Rowe, speaking on behalf 
of the Nets' ownership group. ``We've expressed an interest in them 
coming to Newark with us, and they've expressed an interest in us 
going to Hoboken with them. But that's all at this point.'' The Devils 
are not yet for sale, but if McMullen became the principal owner of 
Washington Redskins of the National Football League, he would be forced 
to relinquish ownership of the Devils. NFL bylaws prohibit the league's 
owners from being the principal owners of another professional sports 
franchise in a different market that competes with an NFL franchise. 
McMullen, who has talked about moving the Devils from the Meadowlands 
to Hoboken, and Charles Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision Systems 
and the owner of Madison Square Garden, the Knicks and the Rangers, 
have submitted a joint proposal for the Redskins and Jack Kent Cooke 
Stadium. As one of five groups whose offer is being considered by 
the holders of the Cooke estate, McMullen and Dolan could find out 
as early as next week whether their bid was accepted. Most observers 
believe McMullen will become the principal owner if the offer from 
his group is accepted. In that case, the Devils would be placed on 
the market, and the Nets would probably attempt to buy them. The Nets, 
who currently share the Continental Arena with the Devils, would perhaps 
have more incentive than anyone to buy the Devils. The club's new 
ownership group, headed by Lewis Katz and the noted philanthropist 
Ray Chambers, is intent on moving the Nets to a new, state-of-the-art 
facility in Newark and having the Devils as a second tenant would 
practically assure them of being able to complete the move.
