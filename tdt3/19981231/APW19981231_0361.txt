Despite a conciliatory New Year's message from the president of Yugoslavia, 
his government allies vowed Thursday to defend Kosovo with ``all means'' 
and fight against NATO if it intervenes in the troubled Serbian province. 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Wednesday predicted a political 
solution for the Kosovo conflict would come next year. Milosevic, 
in a year-end message read on state television, said he expected 1999 
to lead to a ``multi-ethnic Kosovo, based on the principles of equality 
for all.'' But ultra-nationalist Serbian Vice Premier Vojislav Seselj 
said Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia, is taking continued 
NATO threats of intervention in Kosovo very seriously, and ``we are 
ready to defend it.'' He blasted NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, 
who this week said NATO won't tolerate violence in Kosovo and was 
ready to intervene. ``Warnings of Javier Solana remind me of one-time 
threats by Adolf Hitler,'' Seselj told reporters. ``NATO is an aggressive 
military force threatening the whole mankind.'' In his year-end address, 
Milosevic said no ethnic group would be favored in Kosovo. ``Not the 
Serbs, but not the Albanians either.'' He again ruled out independence 
for Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population, 
saying any efforts to secede would ``come up against the will of the 
people'' of Yugoslavia. In an interview with state-run Serbian Television, 
Milosevic's foreign minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, said, ``We are obliged 
to use all means to oppose the rush of terrorism and separatism'' 
in Kosovo. Jovanovic's and Seslelj's comments heightened concerns 
that the October truce between Serbian security forces and ethnic 
Albanian guerrillas fighting for Kosovo's secession could collapse 
altogether. Four days of fierce fighting last week in northern Kosovo 
claimed at least 15 lives and sent thousands fleeing. Indicating that 
tensions were still simmering, the state news agency Tanjug reported 
that a Serbian police patrol was attacked northwest of Pristina late 
Wednesday by ethnic Albanian rebels. There were no reported casualties. 
Serb officials accuse the guerrillas, the Kosovo Liberation Army, 
of triggering the clashes by attacking police and army units. Jovanovic 
on Tuesday urged the United Nations to declare the KLA a terrorist 
organization and crack down on their support network abroad. The KLA 
asserts they are only responding to attacks on them. A Serb crackdown 
against the earlier this year claimed more than 1,000 lives and left 
about 300,000 people homeless. Milosevic ended the attacks after NATO 
threatened airstrikes.
