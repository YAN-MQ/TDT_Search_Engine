U.S. fighter planes attacked a second Iraqi missile battery Wednesday 
after allied aircraft patrolling the southern no-fly zone come under 
fire. The U.S. planes fired missiles and dropped bombs on the anti 
aircraft site after Iraqi forces fired at British aircraft patrolling 
zone. Iraq claimed its air defense forces had almost certainly shot 
down one plane, but U.S. and British spokesmen say all allied planes 
returned safely after the day's missions. Meanwhile, British Defense 
Secretary George Robertson, says there is growing support for stopping 
Saddam Hussein and Iraq's weapons program. What we did was right and 
was proper and in accordance with international law. And there is 
a growing consensus that even among those who disagreed with military 
action that this man has got to be restrained. He cannot be trusted 
with weapons of mass destruction. On Monday, U.S. planes patrolling 
the no-fly zone in northern Iraq attacked an air defense site that 
fired missiles at them. Also, the U.S. Defense Department says it 
will go ahead with a planned withdrawal of several thousand troops 
from the Persian Gulf area. Military commanders say the remaining 
forces will be adequate.
