First the national forecast. I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your 
"CNN Headline News Weather." A cold remainder of the day over much 
of the northern midwest. Below zero for highs, wind chill factors 
are running some 30 to 40 degrees below zero in parts of Minnesota 
and into northern New England. It is cold, as well, in the wind chill 
department. On this new year's eve we are looking for snow back through 
Rockies. No major storms today, but we will see one forming by tomorrow 
morning. Back in through the plains as that big area of Arctic high 
pressure continues to push into the east. Heavy snows by late tomorrow 
are forecast to develop over parts of missouri, these will be heading 
into Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio as we head into the weekend. 
The extended forecast on Saturday shows the heavy snows over those 
areas. We could Se significant icing over parts of Virginia and North 
Carolina. Rain in the southeast and strong to severe thunderstorms 
are possible along the gulf coast. On Sunday, heavy snows possible 
through the Great Lakes. We'll find a mix in the northeast, probably 
starting as snow in many of the major metro areas, but it will change 
over to rain during the day on sunday. On Monday, lingering snow showers 
are expected back through the Great Lakes. For even more weather information,
