The parents of an abducted Australian man who died in Yemen said Thursday 
they were not bitter about the Yemeni government's actions, which 
resulted in their son's fatal shooting. Andrew Colin Thirsk, 35, died 
during a two-hour gunfight Tuesday that also claimed the lives of 
three British hostages in the troubled Middle Eastern country. The 
gun battle began when more than 200 government troops and police stormed 
the kidnappers' desert hideout to end the 24-hour ordeal for 16 hostages. 
Survivors said the Yemeni troops fired the first shots, contradicting 
government claims that the Islamic Jihad kidnappers began the fire 
fight. Malcolm and Susan Thirsk, the parents of the dead Australian, 
said they were not bitter about the bungled rescue attempt. ``Personally, 
we're always going to wish they'd done something different...we're 
not bitter, but we wish it had been another way,'' Thirsk's father 
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. ``Sometimes governments 
are going to draw the line in the sand and one day the Australian 
government, I suppose, will have the same issue to cope with,'' he 
said. The family told the Daily Telegraph newspaper that their son 
knew the dangers and risks of traveling in Yemen. The partner at Pricewaterhouse 
Coopers wanted adventure and thought he would be safe in a structured 
tour group, the elder Thirsk told the newspaper. Meanwhile, Australia's 
ambassador to Saudi Arabia has been directed to visit Yemen to investigate 
the killing of Thirsk and the three Britons, Foreign Affairs Minister 
Alexander Downer said. Downer said the ambassador would also ``emphasize 
to the Yemeni authorities that we would like there to be a full and 
thorough investigation of this incident.''
