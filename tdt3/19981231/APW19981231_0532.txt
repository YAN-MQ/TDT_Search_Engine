Eight supporters of a leftist rebellion who were convicted in a 1989 
kidnapping ended a 46-day hunger strike Thursday and accepted a government 
proposal expected to result in their early release, their spokesman 
said. ``The hunger strike is over,'' said Breno Altman, president 
of the Committee to Free Political Prisoners. Doctors at Sao Paulo's 
Hospital das Clinicas, where the prisoners were being fed intravenously, 
said it will take at least five days for them to recover. Five Chileans, 
two Argentines and one Brazilian started their hunger strike Nov. 
16 to force the government to release them. They have been in prison 
nine years for the 1989 kidnapping of Abilio Diniz, owner of Brazil's 
largest supermarket chain. Police freed him six days later, unharmed, 
after tracing the kidnappers with the help of a van-rental receipt 
found at the kidnapping site. At their trial, the 10 members of the 
kidnapping ring claimed they were political prisoners because they 
planned to donate the dlrs 30 million ransom they had demanded to 
El Salvador's leftist guerrillas. Two Canadians also convicted in 
the kidnapping, David Lamont and Christine Spencer, were transferred 
to a Vancouver prison on Nov. 20 under a prisoner-transfer treaty. 
Earlier this week, the government decided it could transfer other 
inmates to their home countries in anticipation of pending approval 
of similar treaties in those countries. It said the Brazilian would 
eventually be given parole or placed in a work-release program. On 
Wednesday Altman said the government's decision was a ``a major victory, 
because the foreign prisoners would be sent home where they would 
probably be quickly paroled _ a right Brazilian courts have always 
denied them.'' However, the kidnappers initially refused to end their 
fast because the government failed to offer any concrete guarantees 
for an early release of the Brazilian. Altman said on Thursday that 
the prisoners changed their mind after they received assurances that 
the Brazilian would be transferred to his home state of Ceara, in 
northeastern Brazil ``where judges are more lenient.'' A recent Sao 
Paulo court ruling had paved the way for parole or work-release as 
early as February by reducing the prisoners' sentences to between 
15 and 18 years from 26 to 28 years. But Judge Otavio Augusto Machado 
do Barros insisted he would not grant early release because ``they 
have failed all their psychological evaluations and have shown no 
remorse for their crime.'' The hunger strikers are: Ulisses Gallardo, 
Maria Marchi Badilla, Pedro Lembach, Sergio Urtubia and Hector Ramon 
Tapia of Chile; Humberto and Horacio Paz of Argentina; and Brazilian 
Raimundo Freire.
