Jed Johnson, the interior designer, used to advise clients to ``start 
with a good rug and build the room around it.'' Designers who follow 
this credo have a treat in store, though it will last only one week. 
On Jan. 14 Doris Leslie Blau, a veteran Manhattan carpet dealer, is 
opening ``Les Annees Folles'' (``The Crazy Years''), an exhibition 
of about 30 rare Art Deco rugs, at the Beadleston Gallery at 724 Fifth 
Ave., near 56th Street. A homage to the artists who reinvented carpet 
styling between 1920 and 1940, the show, which runs through Jan. 21, 
was organized in conjunction with the Textilia gallery in Rome, where 
it has already been on display. ``These artists revolutionized the 
style of rugs,'' Mrs. Blau said. ``For the first time, there is no 
Oriental influence.'' She added: ``These rugs aren't copies of anything. 
They are based on no previous design. They were inspired by music, 
art and furniture.'' Many artists in the show, like Jules and Paule 
Leleu, Ivan Da Silva Bruhns and Marion Dorn, are not well known, though 
they were famous in their own time. ``These people did paintings, 
drawings, furniture and carpets,'' Mrs. Blau explained. ``I think 
they did the floor coverings after they had done the rest of the decor. 
For them, the mood of a room was set by the art, the textiles and 
furniture. From these things, they interpreted something to go on 
the floor.'' The rugs are neither handmade nor one of a kind, but 
most were created in limited editions. ``Traditionally, designers 
were an integral part of the making of the rug; they were there from 
start to finish,'' said Mrs. Blau, who opened her rug gallery in 1972. 
``The Deco designers were different. They were artists who simply 
decided to do rugs. They did not work at the factories.'' In style, 
the rugs made after 1925 tend to be abstract and geometric, with overlapping 
blocks of color. The rug artists were vehemently antihistoricist. 
As Roberto Danon, an owner of Textilia, wrote in the show's catalog, 
``For the first time, the concept of tradition was seriously put into 
question.'' He added: ``The modern designers adapted to their time. 
In fact, they leaned toward aesthetics inspired by mechanization and 
speed, linked to different movements such as Futurism and the specific 
branch of Cubism influence by African art.'' Most of the artists participated 
in the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels 
Modernes, which was held in Paris in 1925 and gave Art Deco its name. 
Originally planned for 1907, rescheduled for 1912 and postponed again 
until after World War I, the show featured fashion, textiles, interior 
decoration, furniture design and architecture. The artists in the 
1925 exposition were a Who's Who of French Deco design. There were 
interiors by Robert Mallet-Stevens, furniture by Pierre Chareau, glass 
by Rene Lalique and silver by Jean Puiforcat. None of those big names 
designed rugs for the fair, Mrs. Blau said, and none are in her show. 
Mrs. Blau said her exhibition pointed out the great artistic distance 
between Art Nouveau and Art Deco. ``Art Nouveau was round and curvey,'' 
Mrs. Blau said. ``Deco was clean and minimalist.'' Deco artists adapted 
a new palette for their rugs. Some used quiet colors: taupes with 
sandy beiges and browns. Others combined bold, vivid colors, like 
purple with yellow, orange with brown, or pink with aqua. ``The rugs 
are either earthy or brilliant,'' Mrs. Blau said. ``I think the theatrical, 
bold ones have a lot to do with the music that African-Americans introduced 
to France in the 1920s. Think of jazz and Josephine Baker.'' Danon 
wrote, ``The use and choice of color pervade the French environment 
of the time.'' He suggested that the designers adapted the colors 
in Fauvist paintings and in sets seen in Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. 
One rug in the show looks like an abstract painting of a pale blue 
mountain range set against a brown sky. Thin vertical lines in white 
and aqua rain down from the sky, almost like a meteor shower. The 
rug was designed around 1930 by Marion Dorn, an American who lived 
in Paris from 1921 to 1925 and who became the best-known carpet designer 
in Britain in the 1930s. Dorn was prolific; she designed textiles 
in Modernist motifs for Claridges and other hotels and the ocean liner 
Queen Mary. She also did the white carpet for Syrie Maugham's famous 
all-white London living room in 1933. Dorn was married to the American 
poster artist and costume and set designer Edward McKnight Kauffer. 
They lived in London until 1940, then returned to the United States. 
What makes Dorn's rug noteworthy is that it has a top and bottom, 
like a painting. One yearns to see the interior it was designed for. 
Another rug in the show is done in an abstract red and purple diamond 
pattern. Signed ``Leleu,'' it may have been designed by Jules-Emile 
Leleu, a French designer who did interiors for more than 20 ocean 
liners, including the Ile de France in 1926 and the Normandie in 1935. 
Or the artist might have been his daughter Paule Leleu, a painter 
and designer. Eddy Keshishian, an owner of the Keshishian rug gallery 
in London and an authority on Deco carpets, pointed out the importance 
of women designers in this period. ``Perhaps it was the result of 
the suffragette movement,'' he said. ``It was the first time women 
had a chance to promote themselves. They became the home furnishers 
rather than letting the men dictate to them anymore.'' Paule Leleu 
often collaborated with Ivan Da Silva Bruhns, an artist who is not 
yet in most design dictionaries but is represented by two circa 1930 
rugs in the Blau show. The son of Brazilians, Bruhns, a painter, worked 
in France in the early 1900s. ``He was influenced by Cubist painters, 
Picasso in particular, and in his rugs he adopted bold interlocking 
shapes relieved by small motifs,'' Keshishian said. ``He was most 
inspired by an exhibition of crafts from the French colonies in Marseilles 
in 1922. He saw Berber rugs from Morocco for the first time and soon 
began using their browns and creamy colors.'' Keshishian is selling 
a rug that he said Bruhns was commissioned to create for the bedroom 
of the Maharajah of Indore, who decorated his new modernist palace, 
Manik Bagh, in the early 1930s. ``The palace was one of the largest 
Art Deco projects ever undertaken,'' Keshishian said. ``The furniture 
was supplied by Ruhlmann, Charlotte Alix and Eileen Gray. Sotheby's 
auctioned 200 works from the palace in Monaco in 1980.'' Deco rugs 
were the first made in different shapes, like circles, ovals and triangles, 
Keshishian said. They tend to be small but still pricey. Those at 
the Blau show range from $12,000 to $65,000.
