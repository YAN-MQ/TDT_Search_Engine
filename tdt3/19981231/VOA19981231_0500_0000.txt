U.S. fighter planes have attacked a second Iraqi missile battery after 
allied aircraft patrolling the southern no-fly zone come under fire. 
President Clinton speaks with Boris Yeltsin about their differences 
over international policy toward Iraq. Western tourists freed in a 
deadly rescue attempt in Yemen say security forces started the battle 
that killed four hostages. The Cambodian government's decision to 
give safe haven to two senior leaders of the once dreaded Khmer Rouge 
is harshly criticized by a pro Democracy group. And preparations continue 
for President Clinton's impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate. I'm 
Paul Westpheling. We'll have details on those stories along with sports, 
business, and a whole lot more in this hour of VOA News Now. The news 
is next. I'm David Chadwick, VOA News.
