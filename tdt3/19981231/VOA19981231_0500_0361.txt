While Iraq continues to challenge U.S. and British air power in the 
no-fly zones, the U.S. Defense Department says it will go ahead with 
a plan to downsize its forces in the Persian Gulf. U.S. military planners 
say the remaining force will be adequate to handle Iraq. Meanwhile, 
the Clinton administration moved to calm some of the complaints about 
U.S. policy in Iraq. As VOA's Nick Simeone reports from the White 
House, President Clinton telephoned Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
Wednesday to discuss their disagreements about how to handle the situation. 
It was the first conversation between President Clinton and Yeltsin 
in weeks and came on the same day that American pilots were again 
in action over the skies of Iraq, this time targeting another Iraqi 
surface-to-air-missile site. During their 40-minute phone call, White 
House spokesman David Levy says Mr. Clinton explained to President 
Yeltsin why he believes force was necessary in dealing with Iraq's 
defiance of the West. Russia strongly opposed the U.S. and British 
air strikes on Iraq and temporarily recalled its ambassador to Washington 
in protest. But Spokesman Levy says both leaders strongly agree such 
differences should not be allowed to scuttle important issues of common 
concern facing them in the new year. We have a longstanding difference 
with the Russians on Iraq, and he, you know, again, the presidents 
agree that the relationship is too broad, too deep, too important 
not to go forward in a very strong, systematic way. Issues where both 
presidents hope to see progress include arms control, in particular, 
getting Russia's parliament to ratify the 1993 Start 2 Arms Control 
Treaty, which has languished in the Russian Duma for nearly six years. 
President Yeltsin reiterated his strong support for Start 2. And both 
presidents agreed that was in both country's interest to ratify and 
move forward on Start 2. And we're hopeful the Duma will take that 
up as soon as the new year begins. Earlier this month, the Russian 
Duma again delayed consideration of the treaty because of anger over 
the four-day bombardment of Iraq. Nick Simeone, VOA News at the White 
House.
