Police clamped an overnight curfew Thursday in a city in southwestern 
India following Hindu-Muslim clashes that killed five people and were 
sparked by an incident in which Muslim men teased a Hindu woman. At 
least 50 people were injured since violence broke out Tuesday night 
in Suratkal, a coastal town in Karnataka state, police said. Tension 
spread Thursday night to the nearby city of Mangalore and state police 
chief T. Srinivasulu imposed a curfew there until dawn. Since Tuesday, 
mobs have attacked Hindus and Muslims in their houses. Three Muslims 
and one Hindu have been stabbed to death in the fighting. Police fired 
bullets on Wednesday to disperse rioters, killing one Hindu protester 
in Suratkal.
