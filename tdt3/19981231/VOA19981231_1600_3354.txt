The final poll of college coaches had Nebraska at number one, thanks 
to an impressive 42 to 17 Orange Bowl victory over Tennessee. Nebraska 
head coaching legend Tom Osborne led the Corn Huskers to a perfect 
13 and 0 record and retired after winning a third national title in 
four years. When you go 13 and 0 and had the kind of year we had, 
we would hope some kind of recognition would come also. And so we're 
all very gratified that the coaches voted as they did.
