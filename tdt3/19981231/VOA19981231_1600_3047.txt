The stock markets London, Paris, and Frankfurt are closed for the 
New Year's, and also to prepare for the introduction of the new common 
currency, the euro. Tokyo's stock market was also closed for the New 
Year's holiday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 73 points Thursday 
to end the year at 10,049. That's down six percent in 1998. London 
gold closed at $287.50 an ounce. That's down 40 cents. And the dollar 
was mostly lower in Europe against other major trading currencies.
