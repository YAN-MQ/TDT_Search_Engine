U.S. and British aircraft patrolled the Iraqi no-fly zones today without 
incident. There were two failed Iraqi missile attacks on the patrol 
planes earlier this week. Deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz told an 
Iraqi newspaper the battle against those he called "the aggressors" 
will continue. The Pentagon says the carrier USS enterprise and its 
battle group will leave the Persian gulf by the weekend. Two dozen 
other ships will remain.
