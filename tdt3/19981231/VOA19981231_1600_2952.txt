The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day and the year 91081. 
That was down 93 points or one percent. For the year, the industrial 
average gained 1273 points, or more than 16 percent. The Standard 
& Poor's 500 Index closed today at 1229. That was down two points. 
However, the NASDAQ Index closed at a record high. Now this was the 
fourth straight year that major American stock averages posted double 
digit percentage gains. Many analysts are optimistic about 1999 but 
do urge some caution. Some analysts are especially worried about many 
of the Internet related stocks, which they say have risen beyond any 
reasonable valuations. Of course all American financial markets will 
be closed Friday for the New Year holiday.
