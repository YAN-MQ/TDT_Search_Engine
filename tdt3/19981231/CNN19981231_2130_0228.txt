CNN has learned vice President Al Gore will file the necessary paperwork 
tomorrow to launch his candidacy for president in 2000. Gore will 
notify the federal election commission by mail of his intention to 
form a campaign committee. The notification means once he has raised 
and spent $5,000, his campaign will be officially recognized and eligible 
for federal matching funds.
