The weather contributed to a freeway pileup today in Michigan. It 
happened on interstate 75 near grayling, 180 miles north of Detroit. 
Authorities say the interstate has now reopened. Dozens of cars crashed 
into one another on the ice-slickened roadway. Officials say one person 
was killed and several more were injured, some seriously. About 100 
stranded motorists were bused to shelters. Police say strong winds 
and light snow created a whiteout.
