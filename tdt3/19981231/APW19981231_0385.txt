BONN, Germany (AP) _Returning to a pet theme, German Finance Minister 
Oskar Lafontaine again hinted he favors further interest rate cuts 
by the European Central Bank on Thursday, just hours before the launch 
of the euro. In an article published in Germany's business daily Handelsblatt, 
Lafontaine said interest rate cuts in early December in the 11 countries 
joining the euro were ``a right step.'' The coordinated cuts on Dec. 
3 lowered the ECB's key interest rate to 3 percent. ``With a stability-oriented 
financial and wage policy, the ECB has more room for a monetary policy 
that supports growth and employment,'' Lafontaine wrote. ``With price 
stability achieved, this room exists.'' Since taking office in October, 
Lafontaine has stirred controversy with repeated calls for lower rates 
to help Europe's governments fight chronically high unemployment and 
flagging growth. Lower interest rates can spur an economy by making 
it cheaper to borrow money. His outspoken stance has been seen as 
a threat to the fledgling ECB's independence, but Lafontaine strongly 
endorsed the bank's independence in the article. The ECB ``is politically 
independent and not subject to directives. No one in Europe will or 
is allowed to question this,'' he wrote. But Lafontaine also called 
for more transparency in the setting of European monetary policy. 
``We must fully use the possibilities for transparency and openness 
in monetary policy that are provided for in the EU treaty,'' Lafontaine 
wrote. In a separate statement to mark the official fixing of the 
euro rates by finance ministers in Brussels Thursday, Lafontaine declared 
Europe had begun a new era, with a currency bloc that rivalled that 
of the United States. ``A currency area is being established that 
is comparable to that of the United States in size and economic strength,'' 
he said, adding Europe should use its new clout to tackle unemployment 
and foster growth. The euro must aide European political integration, 
Germany's central bank president, Hans Tietmeyer, reiterated in a 
separate article in Handelsblatt. ``The euro must facilitate the political 
integration of Europe,'' Tietmeyer said, noting that the currency 
union means countries take on common risks, which binds them together 
politically. He noted that political coordination doesn't mean the 
``centralization'' of politics, rather a ``clear definition of responsibilities.'' 
``There will certainly be enough room for independent national political 
decisions in the future,'' Tietmeyer said.
