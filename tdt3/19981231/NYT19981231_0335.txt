In the first signs of serious discord among Senate Republicans over 
impeachment, several senators, both conservatives and moderates, said 
they opposed a proposal that would permit a preliminary vote on articles 
of impeachment without a full trial. ``That's a whitewash and a shirking 
of our responsibility the Constitution gives us,'' said Sen. James 
Inhofe, a conservative Oklahoman, in a telephone interview Thursday. 
``We have to have witnesses and have a full trial. How can someone 
vote without hearing from witnesses and without hearing all the evidence?'' 
Sen. Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican who served as a Senate 
committee lawyer during the Watergate hearings, echoed Inhofe's concerns 
and said that the Senate must guard against moving too hastily as 
it prepares to sit in judgment of President Clinton. ```It's beginning 
to appear that there's an effort to cut this down to a very short 
period of time at all costs,'' Thompson said Thursday. ``It's important 
that we not try to jury rig some kind of process that will solve our 
short-term political problems, but might not do justice to our obligations.'' 
Under the proposal that is now being floated by Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott of Mississippi and Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the 
minority leader, the House and the White House would take no more 
than two weeks, and as little as a few days, to make their cases to 
the Senate. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist would preside, but 
no witnesses would be called. At the conclusion of the proceeding, 
the Senate would vote on whether the charges are serious enough, and 
the evidence behind them strong enough to warrant a full trial that 
could lead to Clinton's removal from office. The vote would require 
the approval of 67 senators, the same number needed to convict and 
remove Clinton. If the resolution fails, the Senate would then turn 
to a censure proposal, an alternative that is already being hotly 
disputed. In essence, the proposal is a compromise between Republicans, 
who want a trial and a vote on articles of impeachment alleging perjury 
and obstruction of justice, and Democrats, who want to put forward 
a censure resolution. The opposition to the compromise idea places 
Lott in a bind as he balances the desires of his conservative supporters 
for an impeachment trial and the desire of moderates to wrap up the 
proceedings swiftly, with Democratic cooperation and as little political 
fallout as possible. Daschle said Thursday he believes that the proposal 
has the backing of most Democrats. But the dissension among Republicans 
could be significant since, under the Senate's complicated rules and 
its tradition of deference to individual members, a single renegade 
can often stall proceedings. If that happened now, a difficult situation 
could be transformed into an untenable one for both the Senate and 
Lott himself. The majority leader has made it clear he is aiming for 
a quick transition from impeachment to Social Security, Medicare and 
other legislative mainstays. ``Trent is between a rock and a hard 
place,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa. ``He's looking at enormous 
public opposition to an extended trial, but on the other hand, he's 
considering the Senate's obligation to have a trial.''
