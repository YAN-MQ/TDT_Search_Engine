Authorities have detained a pacific gas and electric employee after 
finding hundreds of pounds of bombmaking materials in the company's 
warehouse in san Francisco this morning. 250 pounds of ammonium nitrate, 
a chemical used in the Oklahoma City bombing, were found thawing in 
a locker. Other chemicals, books on bombmaking and explosives were 
found elsewhere in the building. The employee reportedly led authorities 
to a second PG&E building, and a Police bomb squad is at the scene.
