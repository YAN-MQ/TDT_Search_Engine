China is calling groundless and irresponsible a U.S. report that says 
Beijing obtained technology that harmed U.S. national security. The 
Chinese Foreign Ministry said it resents a U.S. congressional report 
that says China aggressively sought U.S. technology including sensitive 
military secrets. The majority Republican House committee said Hughes 
and Loral Space Communications provided the technology to China after 
their satellites were destroyed in Chinese rocket explosions.
