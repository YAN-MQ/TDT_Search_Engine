New Year celebrations have begun in some parts of the world as the 
midnight hour ushes out 1998 and marks the beginning of the last year 
of the 20th century. One of the first major New Year celebrations 
occurred in Australia, where it is already 1999. VOA's Challis McDonough 
talked to Australian journalist Ronin Sharkey of Sydney based ABC 
Radio. She asked him to describe the events there, as more than one 
million Australians flocked to Sydney Harbor to ring in the New Year. 
New Year celebrations here went very well. They organized a fireworks 
spectacular, which is a traditional event here in Sydney on New Year's 
Eve. That ran at so that families can get into town and sit around 
the harbor four shores and watch the event. And tonight, it was billed 
as a leader, the warm up to the New Year celebrations from 1999 and 
also for the Sydney Olympics. So quite a lot of attention went into 
tonight's event. There were fireworks around the harbor from various 
locations so you had quite a spectacular event with fireworks spilling 
over the harbor bridge across Sydney's beautiful harbor here, and 
also from two or three other vantage points. So we had police estimated 
up to 800,000 people lining the harbor four shores to view the spectacular. 
Did you get a sense of how people were responding to it? People react 
very well. I was down at one of the sites and it's really - it's a 
real kind of childlike reaction from grown ups and people of all ages. 
You hear the oohs and ahs as the fireworks go up and it's a really 
animated kind of response that never seems to diminish from year to 
year. Australian radio reporter, Ronin Sharkey, speaking with VOA's 
Challis McDonough.
