The U.S. ambassador closed the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv on Thursday 
after receiving ``credible and specific threats,'' a U.S. official 
said. The official, U.S. Consulate spokesman Anne Casper, would not 
elaborate, but Israeli radio stations said the threats were directed 
at embassy staff. Outside the embassy, Israeli border police officers 
were seen talking to U.S. security officials and taking notes. U.S. 
Ambassador Ned Walker ordered the embassy closed after receiving the 
threats, Casper said. U.S. officials notified the appropriate Israeli 
authorities, she said. Tel Aviv police spokesman Nitza Friedman said 
``police are doing what they have to do.''
