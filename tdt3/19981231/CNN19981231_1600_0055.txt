Bone-chilling weather is the rule today over much of the eastern half 
of the nation. Fresh snow fell this morning on parts of the virginias. 
More than 14,000 Virginia residents are still without electricity 
after last week's ice storm. And forecasters warn more icy weather 
is possible this weekend. New England received its first heavy snowfall 
of the season yesterday. There were accumulations of nearly eight 
inches in parts of New Hampshire and Maine. Sub-zero temperatures 
were the rule this morning from Nebraska to Maine. And wind chills 
are dropping to 40 and even 60 below zero today, from the upper Great 
Lakes to northern New England.
