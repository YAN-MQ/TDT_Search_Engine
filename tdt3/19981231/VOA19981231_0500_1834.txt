U.S. fighter planes attacked installations in Iraq on Wednesday, the 
second clash in three days between allied and Iraqi military forces. 
Pentagon officials say U.S. missiles and bombs hit anti-aircraft positions 
in southern Iraq, and they deny claims that Iraq shot down one of 
the planes. U.S. and British officials say Iraq started the fight 
by firing anti-aircraft missiles at British planes patrolling the 
southern no-fly zone. We have more on this from VOA's Pentagon correspondent 
Jim Randall. Wednesday morning, near Talio, Iraq, a British pilot 
saw six to eight missiles streaking toward him. He dodged them and 
called for help. Six U.S. planes arrived, including at least one equipped 
blind air defenses by jamming radar. The EA6B prowler fired a radar 
seeking missile at the Iraqi units. Another harm missile was fired 
by a U.S. F-16 CJ, that's an aircraft specially designed and equipped 
to wreck air defenses. F-16s also dropped 225 kilogram laser guided 
bombs. Video pictures of the attack show the bombs hitting Iraqi targets, 
but U.S. Air Force officers say it will take at least one more day 
to determine how much damage was done. A White House spokesman says 
allied planes will continue to enforce the no-fly zones vigorously 
despite Iraqi threats to shoot at patrolling U.S. and British planes. 
The no-fly zones were set up after the 1991 Gulf War to prevent Iraqi 
attacks against Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south. 
The zones cover Iraqi territory north of the 36th parallel and south 
of the 33rd. Monday, U.S. planes patrolling northern Iraq attacked 
an Iraqi air defense site that fired missiles at them. That missile 
exchange left four Iraqi soldiers dead. Pentagon officials say the 
recent missile duels will not change plans to reduce U.S. forces in 
the Persian Gulf. Thousands of troops and dozens of planes were rushed 
to the area to bolster U.S. forces before mid-December's major air 
strikes on Iraq. Most of the B-52 heavy bombers used in Operation 
Desert Fox are back in the United States and the carrier U.S.S. Enterprise 
is due to leave the Gulf shortly. Officials say in a few days, U.S. 
forces will return to their pre-Desert Fox levels of about 22,000 
people and a bit less than 200 aircraft. Jim Randall, VOA News at 
the Pentagon.
