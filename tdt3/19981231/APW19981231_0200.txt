Indonesia's economy shrank nearly 14 percent and prices rose 78 percent 
in 1998 during the worst financial crisis in three decades, the government 
said Thursday. Indonesian officials said the economic outlook for 
1999 is uncertain although the worst of the turmoil that stripped 
millions of people of their jobs appears to have ended. Inflation 
is expected to range between 15 percent and 20 percent in 1999, said 
Sugito, chairman of the state Central Bureau of Statistics. He said 
the economy could contract by as much as 2 percent or grow as much 
as 1.5 percent next year. Triggered by the crash of Asian currencies 
in 1997, Indonesia's economic malaise was aggravated by political 
unrest that led to the ouster in May of former President Suharto. 
Critics allege that official corruption under the authoritarian Suharto 
contributed to the economic turmoil in Indonesia, which has received 
billions of dollars in aid from the International Monetary Fund and 
other foreign lenders. Prices rose 1.42 percent in December, an increase 
of 0.08 percent over the rate in November, the government said. Inflation 
for the year was 77.63 percent and the economy contracted 13.68 percent. 
Sugito said most industries in the world's fourth most populous nation 
contracted in 1998, except for agriculture, electricity, gas, and 
potable water. Predictions for the economy next year are clouded by 
political uncertainty and the fear of unrest ahead of parliamentary 
elections scheduled for June. ``Next year is a very unpredictable 
year,'' Sugito said. ``We don't know if the election will be smooth, 
and we don't know if the new government will maintain current economic 
policies.'' Indonesia has closed insolvent banks and has taken other 
steps to reform its economy in line with terms of the IMF-led bailout 
plan.
