When the American Basketball League folded on Dec. 22, most players 
got the news that afternoon from their team's offices. But not Limor 
Mizrachi of the New England Blizzard. She heard about it in a phone 
call, a day later, from one of her sisters in Israel. ``My sister, 
Sigi, heard about it on the radio back home and called my mother's 
aunt's house in Fort Lauderdale, where she thought I was,'' said Mizrachi, 
the first and only Israeli player in the women's pro league which 
went out of business less than half way through its third season because 
of a money shortage. ``But at the time, I was in Orlando'' _ at Disney 
World _ ``with my mother and father and no one knew how to reach us.'' 
As it developed, the 28-year-old Mizrachi, a three-time most valuable 
player of the Israeli women's professional league, did not find out 
about the ABL's collapse until she and her parents arrived back at 
her aunt's home in Fort Lauderdale on Dec. 23, the day after the league 
had announced it was ceasing operations. ``When she told me about 
the phone calls, I thought she was talking about the Israeli league,'' 
Mizrachi said in an interview from her home in Connecticut. A flashy 
point guard whose no-look passes and deadly 3-point shooting are her 
trademarks, Mizrachi had gone to Florida with her parents _ who were 
visiting from Israel _ for a few days after the team's coach, K.C. 
Jones, had given his players a break between what turned out to be 
the Blizzard's last game on Dec. 19 and a scheduled Christmas Day 
game in Nashville. Instead, Mizrachi flew to Connecticut with her 
mother, Shula, and her father, Natan, on Dec. 26. ``My parents are 
going back to Israel on Saturday,'' said Mizrachi, who has played 
on the Israeli national women's team since she was 15. ``But I'm not 
sure what I'm going to do,'' she said. ``I can't go back and play 
in the Israeli league, because the season has started, and, once it's 
started, you can't play in the league if you've been playing in another 
country. But I've been in touch with my agent, and it's possible I 
could play in Europe. But for now, I'm staying in Connecticut.'' That 
would be in a rented apartment in Rocky Hill, a Hartford suburb that 
is a far cry from her family home in Givataim, a town near Tel Aviv. 
She began the season slowly, as a backup guard to Jones and Jennifer 
Rizzotti. But she had started the team's last six games after Jones 
was lost for the rest of the season following a knee injury. In her 
last five games, the 5-foot-7-inch Israeli, playing in the backcourt 
with Rizzotti, had averaged 11 points a game. She had began to play 
more aggressively. ``Limor is a great player,'' Jones, the coach and 
basketball Hall of Famer, said. ``She didn't do too much at the beginning, 
and had a tendency to go for a steal every time, which often left 
her out of position. But we had a chat and she had become more contained 
on defense. There's a certain hardness about her as a player. And 
she's a great passer who sees the court so well. Plus she's intelligent, 
tricky and deceptive.'' Jones' assistant coach, Boe Pearman, helped 
recruit Mizrachi, when she was an assistant at Maryland during the 
1991-92 season. That season, Mizrachi started all 30 games for the 
Terrapins, who reached the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
East Regional final. ``We recruited Limor on the basis of a tape that 
a former Israeli player we had had sent to us,'' Pearman said. ``She 
was flashy with a lot of pizazz, and the fans, including a lot of 
embassy people from Washington, loved to watch her play. But she was 
also the consummate point guard who beat you with her skills, her 
mind and her quickness.'' But after one season at Maryland, Mizrachi, 
who still holds the school's single-season record for 3-point accuracy 
(41.6 percent), returned to Israel after her mother was diagnosed 
with cancer. Earlier, Mizrachi was about halfway though a mandatory 
two-year tour of duty in the Israeli Army when the Gulf War broke 
out. Assigned to a base in Tel Aviv as a weight-lifting instructor, 
she would dribble a basketball while walking the three miles to the 
base and home every day. ``There were times when I heard missiles'' 
_ that had been fired at Israel from Iraq _ ``and it was scary. One 
missile landed near my grandmother's house and did considerable damage.'' 
Despite renewed tension in the Middle East, Mizrachi is prepared to 
return to Israel. ``I'm sad that the league ended, but I have no regrets 
over coming here to play,'' she said. ``It was a great experience, 
playing against so many good players. And K.C. Jones was such a great 
coach and great person to play under. I'm going to miss everybody. 
But maybe I can come back to play in the WNBA.''
