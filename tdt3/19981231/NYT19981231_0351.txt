Ray Lucas saw it shimmering in the meeting Thursday as the Jets went 
back to work. But he was afraid to say a word. ``I thought Bill was 
going to jump at me for staring,'' said Lucas, the backup quarterback 
and special-teamer. ``With Bill, you never know what he's trying to 
get at.'' What was sparkling before Lucas' eyes was the Super Bowl 
XXV ring, the one with the two huge diamonds, one for each Giants 
Super Bowl victory, that Parcells wore Thursday. It was the first 
time as Jets coach he showed up with either of his Giants Super Bowl 
rings, which he earned after the 1986 and 1990 seasons. But why shouldn't 
he wear one of his rings on this very morning? After all, the Jets 
began the serious work of preparing for their first home playoff game 
in 12 years as they returned to the practice field after a three-day 
layoff. And at the end of the rainbow is Super Bowl XXXIII. They don't 
play until Jan. 10, and they don't know whether they will face Jacksonville 
or the winner of the Miami-Buffalo game. But they peered at Jacksonville 
films Thursday. It's not that Parcells figures the Jaguars will be 
the Jets' opponent. His team and coaches know more about the Bills 
and Dolphins, having faced them both in the last three weeks. If the 
Jets play either of those teams, there will be enough time next week 
to prepare. Vinny Testaverde has faced the Jaguars more often than 
any other Jet. Even though he has tossed nine touchdowns and thrown 
eight interceptions in six games against them while playing for the 
Browns and Ravens, it's not the statistics that he he remembers. Nor 
does he think Jacksonville will be any less challenging with Mark 
Brunell nursing an ankle sprain at quarterback. ``I've faced them 
twice a year for the last three years,'' Testaverde said. ``I've faced 
them when they've had injuries, and I don't recall ever beating them.'' 
Indeed, Testaverde's teams lost all the games they played against 
the Jaguars since Jacksonville joined the National Football League 
in 1995. Parcells, by contrast, dwelt on the positive Thursday even 
though he never said a word to his team about the ring. Nor would 
he explain why he was wearing it. It is a handsome ornament, with 
``GIANTS'' engraved in yellow gold across the top. There is a circle 
of smaller diamonds surrounding a blue field. In the middle are two 
large almond-shaped diamonds _ one for each Giants Super Bowl triumph. 
This sort of motivational gambit is not unheard of around here. When 
the Jets started their playoff run under Walt Michaels in 1982, he 
showed up in the locker room one day and dumped a few thousand dollars 
in a pile on the floor. ``This is what's at stake here,'' he said. 
But playoff money these days is a smaller percentage of the players' 
take. Parcells was showing them something money can't buy. ``It's 
a pretty big ring,'' someone mentioned to Parcells. ``Yes, it is,'' 
he acknowledged. But he also said, ``I didn't talk to my team about 
the Super Bowl or anything.'' Still, would the players notice? ``Maybe 
they will, maybe they won't,'' he said. ``They'll get a chance to. 
I never wear it. I just felt like putting it on today.'' The players 
noticed, all right. Mo Lewis said that each time Parcells moved his 
right hand, ``my head was bouncing up and down and followed the ring.'' 
The Jets also paid attention, they said, to watching Jacksonville, 
though this was an odd sort of day. It was part of a bye week, and 
they knew there was someone coming up. They just didn't know who. 
``We get the privilege of feeling relaxed right now,'' said tight 
end Kyle Brady. ``We earned an off week for what we did in December.'' 
For Lewis, who earned All-Pro honors Thursday _ the first Jet in 13 
years to do so _ this was highly unusual. ``It's like waiting for 
a baby,'' he said of the anticipation of being in a playoff bye week. 
``You don't know if it's going to be a boy or a girl. We don't know 
who we'll play.'' Lewis is the only current Jet who has ever been 
to a playoff game as a Jet. That was back in his rookie season of 
1991. But now he's concentrating on 1999. ``They've got two good quarterbacks 
that help them win,'' Lewis said after viewing the Jaguar films. ``They 
can both move around and put them in good position.'' Behind Brunell, 
Jacksonville has the rookie quarterback Jonathan Quinn. If the Jaguars 
beat the New England Patriots on Sunday, the Jets' rookie right tackle, 
Jason Fabini, who has faced such strong pass rushers as the Bills' 
Phil Hansen and the Panthers' Kevin Greene, would line up against 
Jacksonville's Bryce Paup. ``They try to get after you,'' Fabini said 
after taking his first look at the Jaguars. ``They're aggressive.'' 
This week the Jets will have three days of watching a team they may 
never face, but they will also work on fundamentals. After taking 
off Saturday and Sunday, they will practice next Tuesday through Friday. 
Parcells admitted he was concerned about fundamentals, and that he 
had not spent enough time drilling his team in cold-weather strategy 
and performance. But he has given them game-situation quizzes. ``Here's 
what you do when the wind's in your face, five seconds to go in the 
game, and you've got the ball and we're ahead,'' Parcells told them 
in one mental drill. He knows there is plenty of time for the Jets 
to go out in the cold again before anyone can think of Super Bowl 
warmth in Miami on Jan. 31.
