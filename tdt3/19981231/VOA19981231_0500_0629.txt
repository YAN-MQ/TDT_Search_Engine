Britain and Australia are seeking more information from Yemen about 
Tuesday's attempt to end a kidnapping which left one Australian and 
three Britons dead. Some of those that survived the ordeal now say 
the killing started when Yemen security forces attacked the kidnappers. 
More from Middle East correspondent Scott Bob. Diplomats in Yemen 
Wednesday were preparing to fly home the bodies of the four tourists 
and evacuate two others who were seriously wounded in the clash. The 
remaining victims were reported to be recovering from their ordeal 
in a hotel in the port city of Adden. They reportedly are to return 
home after talking to Yemeni authorities. British and Australian diplomats 
said they were seeking clarifications on the incident. A British official 
said his government had urged the Yemeni government to negotiate with 
the kidnappers and would be concerned if the attack had been ordered 
too hastily. Yemeni officials say their forces were obliged to attack 
when the kidnappers began killing the tourists. They say three kidnappers 
died and three were wounded in the ensuing care fires. Yemeni citizens 
expressed surprise at the incident Wednesday noting that in the past, 
the government has negotiated for days in hostage situations. They 
said government forces in the past had shelled kidnappers to pressure 
them to release hostages but had never directly attacked them. Scores 
of foreigners have been taken hostage in various incidents in Yemen 
in recent years, but these were the first deaths to result from such 
an incident. The incident was also the first reported to involve Islamic 
extremists. The tourists were taken at gunpoint Monday near the town 
of Maldiya, 200 kilometers south of Sanha. Yemeni officials say their 
abductors were Islamists demanding the release of their leader, who 
was arrested two weeks ago during a government crackdown on religious 
extremists. The kidnappers were said to be members of Yemeni group 
called Islamic Jihad, which fought in Afghanistan in the 1980s. The 
government two weeks ago arrested their leader when it closed down 
what it said was a military training camp in the region. Scott Bob,
