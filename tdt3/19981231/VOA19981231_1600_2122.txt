The nomination of a prime minister for the Serb republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
has sparked new controversy among local politicians. Hard line nationalist 
Serb President Mikola Ploploson asked Brano Milieuse, a moderate, 
to form a new government. But within hours, the nominee's own party, 
the Independent Social Democrats, rejected the selection. The party 
again pressed Mr. Ploploson to retain the current prime minister.
