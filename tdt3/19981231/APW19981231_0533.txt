Already on top of the Primera Division, and with last-placed Extremadura 
immediately ahead, Mallorca looks be starting the New Year as well 
as it ended the last one. With a 2-1-1 record since taking over the 
league lead on Nov. 21, Mallorca has extended its advantage atop the 
table to four points. Having to travel to 3-3-9 Extremadura on Sunday 
hardly seems more than a bump in the road to team that has allowed 
only six goals in 15 games. Making only its second appearance in the 
first division in its history, Extremadura is looking to prove it 
can avoid its showing of 1996-97, when it debuted in the Primera only 
to finish 19th and immediately fall back into the lower rank. It has 
been outscored nearly 3-1 (24-9) and has won only three of its 15 
matches. Despite being more successful, the performance of perennial 
powers Barcelona and Real Madrid has been much more disappointing. 
Languishing in ninth, Barcelona has won only one of its last five 
league matches and is emersed in a major crisis with Dutch coach Louis 
Van Gaal clinging to his job on a week-to-week basis despite his unpopularity 
with the fans. ``No one understands why, with so many great players, 
we are losing matches,'' Barcelona's Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert 
said Thursday in sports daily El Mundo Deportivo. ``We must beat Alaves 
to start the year on a good footing,'' defender Sergi Barjuan said, 
referring to Sunday's home match. But despite Sergi's assurances that 
``little by little things are getting back to normal,'' the atmosphere 
clearly remains tense. Earlier this week, club chairman Josep Nunez 
blamed the players for the season's disappointments, including a humiliatingly 
early exit from the European Champions League. Meanwhile, Real Madrid 
also plays Sunday, at home to next-to-last placed Tenerife. Although 
Madrid is still in the running for its eighth European Champions Cup 
title, the club has failed to sparkle in the domestic league and is 
mired in eighth, seven points behind Mallorca. Dutch coach Guus Hiddink 
probably rests uneasily, knowing that his German predecessor, Juup 
Heynckes, was dismised after last season for finishing at a disappointing 
fourth despite having won a record seventh European Champions Cup 
title. In other matches Sunday, second-placed Celta welcomes Oviedo 
in the round's most evenly matched game. Meanwhile, Deportivo La Coruna 
travels to Zaragoza, Atletico plays away against lower-half Racing 
Santander and Athletic Bilbao hosts Valladolid. The week's round also 
provides two lower-half battles pitting Villarreal against Betis, 
and Espanyol against Salamanca while Saturday's only match sees Valencia 
host third-from bottom Salamanca.
