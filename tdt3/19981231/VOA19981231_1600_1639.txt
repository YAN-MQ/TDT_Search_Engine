Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two minute break. This is VOA News Now. Our main business here at 
the Voice of America is to give you a world of information. VOA News 
Now takes you wherever the news is happening, whether it's the no-fly 
zones of Iraq, or the banks of Europe where the euro currency is being 
sorted out even as we speak. We'll make sure you're up to date on 
the latest activities by Boris Yeltsin or Boris Becker, and we'll 
keep your interests, whether the word prince makes you think of Britain's 
Prince Charles or the American recording artist formerly known as 
prince. Now you can help us focus in even more on the news you want 
to know. Drop us a line with your comments about our program. Our 
mail address is VOA News Now, Washington D.C., 20547, USA. Let me 
repeat that. VOA News Now, Washington D.C., 20547, USA. Or you can 
use this E-mail address if you're connected to the Internet: newsnow@voa.gov. 
News Now is written as one word. Now with every note, we ask you pleas 
to let us know where you are and when you listen. And if you can give 
the time in universal time, so much the better. Also, please tell 
us how you listen, giving us your frequency, and if you're listening 
on short wave, medium wave, or FM broadcasts, the cable or satellite 
system you may be linked to, or whether you're listening by logging 
on to our computer Web site. Let me give you the E-mail address once 
again now. That's newsnow@voa.gov. with News Now written as one word. 
Stay tuned as VOA News Now continues with the latest news coming up 
in just a few moments. It's 21 hours 30 universal time. This is VOA

VOA News.
