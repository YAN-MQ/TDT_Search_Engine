They're waltzing into the New Year in the country that's the answer 
to our geography quiz today. That country is Austria. And tonight 
at midnight as they do at the start of every year, radio stations 
all over the nation will play music to honor its Vienna-born Composer 
Johann Strauss. 1999's going to be special. It is the year of the 
Waltz King, the 100th Anniversary of Strauss' death. The year will 
be filled with special events, but the swankest of all comes tomorrow 
morning when the Vienna Philharmonic performs its annual New Year's 
Day concert. This is the hottest ticket in town. Cost even more than 
a Stones concert. But, for a cool $800, you can hear this in person.
