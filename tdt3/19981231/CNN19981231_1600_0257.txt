The U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel, is closed today because of what 
officials call a "credible and specific" security threat. U.S. and 
Israeli officials are investigating and extra Israeli patrols have 
been posted outside the building. Employees were told to stay home 
today. Anti-American sentiment has grown in the Middle East following 
the recent air raids on Iraq and earlier attacks on targets in Sudan 
and Afghanistan in retaliation for bombings at two U.S. embassies 
in Africa.
