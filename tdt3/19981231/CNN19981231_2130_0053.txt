Parts of the eastern United States are still digging out tonight after 
yet another snow storm. More than four inches fell in southwestern 
Virginia today. That made driving slippery, but state police say it 
caused only minor injuries. Road crews in Kansas city, Missouri, are 
bracing for snowfall. Significant ice accumulations are expected tomorrow.
