Just days before the Senate is set to start President Clinton's trial, 
a proposal has emerged that may avoid a full scale hearing. The trial 
over the Monica Lewinsky affair could be replaced by a censure motion, 
but only if a preliminary vote shows there's no support for the president's 
impeachment. The World's Owen Faye reports from Washington. Republicans 
in the House of Representatives want the Senate to conduct a full 
trial, but all indications are no one else does. The Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott has said he would like to have the entire matter 
concluded by the time the president makes his State of the Union Address, 
January 19th. In order to do that, the trial would have to be severely 
curtail with no witnesses being called. Henry Hyde, the man who chaired 
the committee which drafted the impeachment articles is urging the 
Senate to hear testimony from, among others, Monica Lewinsky. But 
unless he can persuade the Senate leadership otherwise, the process 
may be completed in a matter of weeks. For the World, I'm Owen Faye 
in Washington.
