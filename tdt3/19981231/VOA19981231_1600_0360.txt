at 23 hours universal time, the euro becomes the official currency 
in much of Europe, a move that will create a unified global economic 
power. The euro will take effect in 11 nations and is considered a 
significant step toward the creation of a united Europe. For the next 
three years, the euro will be used only for noncash transactions such 
as credit purchases. To prepare for the transaction or for the transition, 
I should say, thousands of Europeans will put in overtime to update 
computers and answer questions about the euro. Deutsche Bank, Germany's 
biggest, has called 2,000 employees to work over the holiday weekend. 
Meanwhile in London, some 50,000 people will gather in the financial 
district for a working weekend. Britain is not taking part in the 
euro project but London is the financial capital of Europe and will 
be a major center for euro trading.
