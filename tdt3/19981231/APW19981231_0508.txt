With many conceding the early lead to South Africa, the soccer federations 
of Germany, England, Brazil, Morocco, Egypt and Ghana also officially 
have notified FIFA of their intent to bid for the right to stage the 
2006 World Cup finals. The seven countries formally informed FIFA 
in advance of Thursday night's deadline. They have until July 31 to 
submit their full bid documents. FIFA's 24-member Executive Committee 
will decide the host in March 2000. FIFA President Sepp Blatter repeatedly 
has said there is a responsibility to stage the tournament in Africa, 
which has never hosted the finals. Morocco lost to France for the 
1998 finals and the United States in 1994. Despite its high crime 
rate, South Africa is widely considered the front-runner. It hosted 
the 1995 Rugby World Cup, the 1996 African Nations Cup and the athletics 
World Cup this year. South African officials maintain they can keep 
crime under control and say their infrastructure is developed enough 
to cope with the demands of the tournament. ``We are confident that 
we have a formidable case, said Danny Jordaan, chief executive of 
South Africa's bid committee. ``It is recognized by many of the international 
guests that come to our country that we will be there in the end,'' 
he told the BBC's Radio 5 Live. ``Our view is being shared by many 
people inside FIFA _ that it is Africa's turn ... and that we do have 
the infrastructure, and the capacity to add a new and refreshing dimension 
to the World Cup.'' The case for either Germany or England is weakened 
by the fact that they are from the same continent. The 2002 finals 
are being split between Japan and South Korea _ but FIFA insists that 
co-hosting will be a one-time exception. ``Certainly, emotionally, 
there is some support for South Africa because their continent has 
never had it before,'' conceded England's bid chief Alec McGivan. 
``That is something we have to overcome. ``The question is when will 
an African candidate be ready to take on what is a huge logistical 
exercise?'' Underlining the increasing European rivalry, McGivan said 
in a radio interview that Germans were envious at the amount of support 
given by the British government to England's bid. He said he didn't 
think the bribery scandal rocking British soccer would be ``an issue 
at all'' in FIFA's choice of site. Hoping to boost its standing in 
the eyes of FIFA, reigning European champion Germany agreed earlier 
this month to be the contintent's representative in next summer's 
Confederation Cup. It replaces World Cup champion France, which withdrew 
for scheduling reasons.
