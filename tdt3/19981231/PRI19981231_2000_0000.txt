A co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI, and WGBH Boston. It's 
New Years Eve 1998. I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. On the eve of the 
year of the euro, preparations for a single European currency and 
worries about how Washington will receive a congressional report concluding 
that high technology deals with China have damaged US national security. 
My fear is that these allegations will not be dealt with seriously, 
but instead will become political hand grenades for lobbying at the 
executive branch. Also, skeletons in a Finnish closet and rhythms 
in a Cuban tradition. First up, this news.
