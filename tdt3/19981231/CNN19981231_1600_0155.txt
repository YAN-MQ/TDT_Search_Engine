Mr. Clinton is far from the fray for now. He and the first family 
are in Hilton head, South Carolina, for the annual renaissance weekend. 
The first order of business today was a round of golf. The president 
says he'll spend part of the weekend working on his state of the union 
address, new federal budget and his new year's resolutions. Chris 
black tells us what else is on the agenda. President Clinton is Ringing 
out 1998 the same way he has ended every year for the past 15 at the 
annual new year's renaissance weekend, a Highbrow talk-A-thon held 
near the beaches of Hilton head. The weekend is billed as a family 
retreat, a time for renewal and recreation. Each year the Clintons 
visit with old friends, enjoy the mild temperatures and talk away 
at panel discussions ranging from global warming to family relationships. 
The sessions are all held far from the cameras and the eye of the 
press. Participants include ambassadors and artists, astronauts and 
Olympic athletes. This year the guests include sex therapist Dr. Ruth 
westheimer and Supreme Court justice Stephen breyer. But this past 
year was not like any other. In January, independent counsel Ken Starr 
began investigating the president's relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
The scandal dominated the year and ended with his impeachment this 
month. We talk about the issues of the year every year. Obviously, 
the current events of the year figured into the discussion, and i'm 
sure they will be addressed. Even before the president's arrival, 
protesters had assembled, calling for his removal from office. But 
civility is a watchword at this weekend retreat, and the president 
is hoping to spend a few quiet days with friends, family and his dog 
buddy before returning to Washington to face a Senate trial that is 
the biggest threat of his presidency. Chris black, CNN, Hilton head, 
South Carolina.
