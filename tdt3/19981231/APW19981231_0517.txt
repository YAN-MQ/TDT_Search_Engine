Some two thousand Iranians protesting the murders of a dissident and 
his wife clashed with hard-line militants in the capital Thursday. 
Riot police broke up the fracas outside the Fakhr Mosque in central 
Tehran, arresting a number of protesters. The police did not explain 
why no militants were detained. The protesters had attended a two-hour 
service in the mosque to mark the 40th day after the death of Dariush 
Foruhar and his wife, who were found stabbed to death in their Tehran 
home on Nov. 22. Foruhar, 70, was the leader of the Iran Nation Party, 
a small opposition group that is tolerated by the government. He was 
a member of the Cabinet of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan immediately 
after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Emerging from the mosque, the mourners 
began chanting pro-democracy slogans such as ``Freedom, security _ 
that is the slogan of the nation'' and ``Death to autocracy.'' Despite 
the presence of some 200 riot-police, who had cordoned off the mosque, 
dozens of militants charged the protesters and fist-fights broke out. 
No one was seriously injured in the 20 minutes it took for the police 
to restore order. Hard-line militants have attacked a number of leading 
moderates and pro-democracy activists this year. They are believed 
to enjoy the backing of powerful conservatives in the ruling hierarchy. 
In addition to the Foruhars, three dissidents have died in mysterious 
circumstances over the past two months. They were all critical of 
the government's hard-line clergymen who are trying to stymie the 
social and political reforms of President Mohammad Khatami. Two more 
political activists remain missing. Khatami and the judiciary have 
set up committees to investigate the deaths. The presidential committee 
submitted an interim report Thursday, the official Islamic Republic 
News Agency said. The agency said the report showed ``desirable progress,'' 
but that Khatami had called for ``an accelerated pace of investigation.'' 
Police say they have arrested several suspects, but have not provided 
details. Meanwhile, members of a second small opposition party, the 
Iran Freedom Movement, handed in a letter to Khatami's office on Thursday 
urging the president to make public the results of the investigations 
so far.
