Good evening. And it is an evening in which people are literally shivering 
in anticipation of the new year. A deep freeze is hitting much of 
the nation, the kind of cold that makes your face hurt. Temperatures 
as low as 20 below in Minnesota. And it's awfully cold in plenty of 
other places, with forecasts of major winter storms to come. In Michigan 
today, there were already deadly results from the brutal weather -- 
a huge pileup along a busy interstate north of Detroit. Here's ABC's 
Jim Williams. Drivers along I-75 say minutes before the crash, conditions 
were clear, then without warning, they were blinded by a whiteout. 
It was like a complete whiteout. It was like right there in front 
of you. Dozens of cars smashed into one another. At least two people 
were killed and paramedics from three counties rushed dozens me hospils. 
On a snowy highway in Cincinnati a tour bus collided with a Van, ured.C 
the accidents occurred as forecasters predicted the worst weather 
is yet to come. A storm is expected to develop over the Rockies, and 
move through the midwest by the weekend. It certainly is a very intense 
storm and probably one of the stronger winter storms we've seen in 
this part of the country in a while. Reporter:ere hicago, the election 
for mayor and the city council is just weeks away, and politicians 
here have learned the hary to take sn roval very seriously. It was 
exactly 20 years ago that heavy snow paralyzed Chicago his job. And 
if that were to happen again, which it won't, whoever was responsible 
would salt are ready to go. It is not the threat of snow, but bitter 
cold that will grip New York for tonight's new year's eve celebration 
at Times Square. You've got to be out in the cold. You gotta be fighting 
the elements. It's all about celebration. it's 1999. It's a big year. 
An estimated 500,000 people are expected to be here as the nation 
rings in the new year and braces for 1999's first storm. Jim Williams, 
ABC News, Chicago.
