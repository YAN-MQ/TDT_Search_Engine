Europeans are Ringing in 1999 with a new common currency. Finance 
ministers from 11 European countries met in Brussels today to launch 
the Euro. They won't be in circulation for another three years, but 
starting tomorrow, the new occur Ren sti will begin challenging the 
U.S. dollar and U.S. businesses. Charles Molineaux explains. For U.S. 
traders, the setting of a value for the Euro injected unusual excitement 
into a normally quiet new year's eve. And bankers here say the transition 
to the Euro could translate into a plus for American shoppers. As 
far as the U.S. consumer is concerned, I'd had thought that increasing 
competition in Europe is gonna kick down the pressure on prices, so 
from their point of view, they could be getting better-quality, lower-priced 
goods from Europe. The bottom line for U.S. businesses is trickier. 
U.S. companies could find it easier to do business with their continental 
counterparts without the fluctuations of 11 different currencies. 
But newly more efficient Euro businesses could also become tougher 
competitors. And the Euro is the first serious challenge in decades 
to the dollar's dominance as the reserve currency of choice. Some 
central banks are already planning to convert part of their reserves 
to the Euro. And some analysts say that could weaken the dollar, although 
not right away. A unified European currency could also make European 
stocks more tempting for American investors, challenging U.S. markets. 
Right now in the U.S., about 10% of all investment portfolios are 
in foreign investments. That's a very small -- a very small number. 
So they're going to be looking at this second largest market in the 
world, the 11 countries represented by the single currency, as to 
what percentage of their investments they should have in those markets. 
The coming of the Euro did offer a one-time opportunity for some investors 
willing to incur some end of the year risk. Over the past few months, 
trading in European currency has fluctuated wildly. That meant an 
opportunity for hedge funds and other investors to bet on it returning 
to its target levels. Charles Molineaux, "CNN Financial News," New 
York.
