A French media watchdog group on Friday urged Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic to use his influence so that an Albanian-language daily 
in Kosovo can resume publication. Bujku, the oldest Albanian-language 
daily in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, was informed Wednesday by a 
state-run printing house that it would no longer put out the paper. 
In a letter sent to Milosevic Wednesday, Reporters without Borders 
said it was ``concerned by the failure of Bujku to appear.'' The group 
urged Milosevic to use his influence to ensure that the newspaper 
would be able to be published again. A terse directive telling employees 
of the Panorama print works, which is owned by the state, not to print 
Bujku was posted Wednesday in the plant. Bujku is one of the three 
largest dailies in Kosovo, a province of Serbia that is inhabited 
mainly by Albanians. Albanian guerrillas seeking independence and 
government forces are locked in a bloody fight for control of the 
province. The Serbian government, after cracking down earlier this 
year on Serbian-language papers, has moved to suppress Albanian-language 
papers because of their backing for independence. Bujku is the first 
Kosovo Albanian newspaper targeted. The state-run plant actually stopped 
printing the daily two weeks ago, claiming it was in arrears for printing 
costs. It has not appeared on newsstands since then. Other Albanian-language 
papers still publishing have said they would defy government pressure 
on them. A copy of the letter from Reporters without Borders was also 
sent to other high-ranking Serb officials, as well as other international 
media watchdog groups.
