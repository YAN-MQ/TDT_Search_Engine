The New Year brings a new currency to most Europeans. We'll look at 
some of the preparations. Iraq says it will continue to challenge 
western planes enforcing the no-fly zones, but patrols continued Thursday 
without incident. The U.S. embassy in Israel closes following what 
a spokesman called a credible and specific threat. In Africa this 
year, hundreds of people were killed and thousands wounded in two 
United States embassy bombings. We'll see how the survivors of those 
blasts are coping with their lives. I'm Tony Riggs. We'll have those 
stories, sports, and business news, and on Dateline, a look at how 
the latest confrontation in the Persian Gulf is hurting the children 
of Iraq. It's all ahead on this hour of VOA News Now. First a summary 
of world news. I'm John Birchard, VOA News.
