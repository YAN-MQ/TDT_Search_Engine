Denmark could hold a plebiscite to join the European Union's common 
currency system within two years, which is earlier than now expected, 
Economy Minister Marianne Jelved said Thursday. ``I have a feeling 
that it will go much faster than we think and that we will hold a 
referendum far earlier than 2001,'' Jelved was quoted as saying by 
the Aktuelt newspaper. Social Democratic Prime Minister Poul Nyrup 
Rasmussen has hinted Denmark likely won't put the question to a referendum 
until at least 2001. Jelved, of the small social-liberal Radical Party, 
made the comment in the wake of recent opinion polls indicating a 
growing number of Danes believe their country should join the 11 EU 
countries which are launching the euro on Jan. 1 Denmark is one of 
four EU countries staying out of the monetary union for the time being. 
After voters in 1992 rejected the Maastricht treaty that established 
the system, Denmark won opt-out clauses which eventually were approved 
by Danish voters. It would take another national referendum for Denmark 
to adopt the new currency. Danish voters traditionally have been lukewarm 
supporters of the EU. Although many politicians support the unified 
currency, they have been wary about bringing the issue to voters again. 
A Gallup poll in Thursday's edition of the Berlingske Tidende daily 
showed 48 percent of surveyed Danes favored the single currency, while 
42 percent were opposed. The remaining 10 percent were undecided. 
The survey was conducted Dec. 27-30 and based on 1,020 interviews. 
No margin of error was given. Earlier this week, another polling institute 
said 54 percent favor Denmark's participation, while 36 percent oppose 
that. In June 1994, 59 percent of surveyed Danes rejected the single 
currency while 33 percent favored it.
