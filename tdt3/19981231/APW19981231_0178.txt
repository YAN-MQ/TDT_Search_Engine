The U.S. ambassador closed the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv on Thursday 
after receiving ``credible'' threats, an embassy spokesman said. The 
spokesman, Larry Schwartz, would not elaborate, but an Israeli security 
source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the threats were 
aimed at the embassy staff. Israel radio said the life of U.S. Ambassador 
Ned Walker was threatened. Schwartz said the embassy was not searched, 
apparently ruling out a possible bomb threat. He said the ``direct 
and credible'' threat was received Wednesday evening and that Walker 
decided to shut down the embassy and informed staff not to report 
to work Thursday. Schwartz said he did not know how long the embassy 
would be closed. On Friday, New Year's Day, the embassy would be closed 
anyhow, followed by the weekend. On Thursday, Israeli border police 
officers were seen talking to U.S. security officials and taking notes. 
An Israeli border police jeep was parked outside the building. Tel 
Aviv police spokesman Nitza Friedman said ``police are doing what 
they have to do.'' U.S. diplomatic missions have been on heightened 
security alert since the twin bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi 
and Dar es Salaam on Aug. 7. The attacks killed 224 people. In retaliation, 
the United States bombed targets in Sudan and Afghanistan that had 
links to Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire and the alleged mastermind 
of the embassy bombings. In the Middle East, there has been growing 
resentment against the United States following the attacks on Sudan 
and Afghanistan and the U.S. bombing of Iraq earlier this month.
