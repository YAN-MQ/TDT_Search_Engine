Europe's dream of monetary union becomes a reality shortly when 11 
nations lock their currencies together to form the euro and create 
a unified global economic power. The birth of the euro is being hailed 
as an historic turning point in international finance and a major 
step toward the drive to create a united Europe. Here is French Finance 
Minister Dominique Strascon. For Lisbon to Helsinki, from Paris to 
Vienna, this remarkable symbol of our identity is our common achievement, 
the reality of Europe for ordinary Europeans, something that many 
had never been aware of. I will not be less French tomorrow, Kalichamp 
will not be less Italian, Jean Jeanclair will not be any less Luxembourgan, 
but we'll all be just a little bit more European. In a New Year's 
address to his nation, Thursday, French President Jacque Chirac said 
the new currency will bring greater stability in an uncertain world.
