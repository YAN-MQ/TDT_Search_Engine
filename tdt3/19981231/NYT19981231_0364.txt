After his first rigorous practice in more than a week, Randy McKay 
sat down on the ice at the South Mountain Arena to speak with New 
Jersey Devils coach Robbie Ftorek. As the discussion went on, there 
was an exhausted McKay, lying on the cold ice. When McKay finally 
retreated to the locker room and struggled to pull his skates off, 
his teammates sarcastically welcomed him back, commenting, ``It wasn't 
the same without you,'' and, ``Great to see you.'' McKay was back 
with the team on the ice for the first time in approximately 10 days. 
In mid-December, he suffered a elbow cut, which required three stitches 
to close. The wound became infected and inflamed, sending him to the 
hospital for two days before Christmas. After the team took a two-day 
Christmas break, McKay then contracted a flu and lost approximately 
10 pounds. The Devils had done just fine without him, winning three 
of the four games he missed. Still, McKay pushed himself Thursday 
and will do so again Friday, hoping to be ready to play when the Devils 
go on the road face Ottawa for the first time since the senators upset 
them in the opening round of the Stanley Cup playoffs last season. 
``I skated for about 20 minutes on Monday and about a half-hour on 
Tuesday,'' McKay said. ``I did not have energy both days, but it was 
mostly to get my legs and muscles back going again. Today was definitely 
my hardest day. I felt good, now I'm a little tired. I think that's 
expected.'' The infection and flu took a toll on his body and while 
McKay insisted that he felt much better Thursday, he may be far from 
game ready. ``I watched him today and I'll watch him tomorrow,'' Ftorek 
said. ``He's lost a lot of weight, and when you lose weight, you lose 
strength. But he skated today and that's part of the job of getting 
back into the lineup.'' There is little need for McKay to rush back. 
In his place, Vadim Sharifijanov has played well, posting two assists 
against St. Louis, a goal against Buffalo on Dec. 28, and then netting 
the first goal of the game and adding an assist Wednesday. ``He's 
been doing really well,'' McKay said of Sharifijanov. ``He's starting 
to put up some numbers. That's great for him. He's been in and out 
of lineup all year. To get a few games back-to-back in the lineup 
and producing is great for his confidence and it's good for the team.'' 
Ftorek is not worrying over how McKay's return will affect the lineup.``Things 
usually work their way out,'' the coach said said. ``You cross the 
bridges as you get to them.'' SLAP SHOTS BOB CARPENTER, who did not 
skate with the team Thursday, had a toe extender made for his skate 
in an effort to ease the pain of a bruised toe.
