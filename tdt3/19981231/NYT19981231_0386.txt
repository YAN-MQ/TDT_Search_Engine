David C. Adams, a former chairman of NBC and member of its board of 
directors, died Dec. 27 at Cedar Manor Nursing Home in Ossining, N.Y. 
A resident of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., Adams was 85. Known for his 
dry wit and lack of pretension, Adams was regarded as one of television's 
most popular executives. He joined NBC's legal staff in 1947 and retired 
in 1980, serving under seven company presidents. In 1969, he took 
what he described as ``an open-ended sabbatical,'' a year that he 
said he hoped would give him time to travel, read, walk, garden, attend 
concerts, and engage in good talk with friends By that time Adams, 
then senior executive vice president, had been responsible for the 
network's legal department, its Washington office, program standards 
and practices, research and planning, advertising, publicity and promotion, 
and relations with affiliated stations. But when the problems of a 
job become too familiar, Adams once said, he subscribed to the need 
for ``repotting.'' After a year of ``repotting'' in Europe, he returned 
to NBC as a member of its board and as executive vice president of 
its corporate staff, dealing in planning and policy matters. Less 
than two years later he was appointed chairman of the company, and 
from 1975 until retirement he served as vice chairman. Born in Buffalo 
on March 5, 1913, Adams received his undergraduate and law degrees 
from the University of Buffalo. In 1941 he joined the legal staff 
of the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, to which he 
returned in 1945 after service in the U.S. Army. He joined NBC two 
years later. Adams is survived by his wife, Ilyana, of Croton-on-Hudson; 
a step-daughter, Kristina Lanin-Stufano of Hamden, Conn.; a daughter-in-law, 
Audrey Adams of Scarsdale, two grandchildren and two step-grandchildren.
