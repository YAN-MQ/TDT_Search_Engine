The United States has suspended deportation orders against 150,000 
migrants from Honduras and Nicaragua, two countries worst hit by Hurricane 
Mitch. Immigration and naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meisner 
says those Hondurans and Nicaraguans eligible for a special status 
will win an 18-month reprieve from deportation. Given the extent of 
the devastation caused by Mitch, we recognize that the road to recovery 
will be long and arduous. That is why the administration has been 
closely monitoring the situation and working with nations in the region 
to respond in ways that ease their overwhelming burden. The Immigration 
Services also granted a 60-day suspension of deportations of migrants 
from Guatemala and El Salvador. Hurricane Mitch devastated Central 
America last month leaving 11,000 people dead.
