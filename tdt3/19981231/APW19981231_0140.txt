Gary Sheffield made more than the entire Montreal Expos roster this 
year, and so did seven other players. Sheffield set a single-season 
salary record at dlrs 14.9 million, heading a record group of major 
leaguers who made dlrs 1 million or more last season, according to 
a study by The Associated Press. The Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder, 
boosted by a dlrs 5 million bonus he received for agreeing to a midseason 
trade from Florida, smashed the previous record of dlrs 10 million, 
set in 1997 by Albert Belle with the Chicago White Sox. Sheffield, 
whose exact earnings were dlrs 14,936,667, not only made more than 
the entire Expos team (dlrs 8,317,500), he also made more than the 
Pittsburgh Pirates (dlrs 13,695,000) and fell just short of the final 
roster of the Marlins (dlrs 15,141,000). A record 36.5 percent of 
players reached dlrs 1 million, up from 34.5 percent last year, according 
to the AP study, which reviewed the contracts of all 894 players on 
Aug. 31 rosters and disabled lists. At the other end, 126 players 
were at the minimum dlrs 170,000 (14.1 percent), nearly one of every 
seven players In 1997, 107 players (13.0 percent) were at the minimum, 
which was dlrs 150,000. In 1999, the minimum jumps to dlrs 200,000, 
which was higher than the average salary until 1982. Following Sheffield 
were Belle (dlrs 10 million), Atlanta pitcher Greg Maddux (dlrs 9.6 
million), St. Louis home-run king Mark McGwire (dlrs 8,928,354), San 
Francisco outfielder Barry Bonds (dlrs 8,916,667), Toronto pitcher 
Roger Clemens (dlrs 8.55 million), Atlanta first baseman Andres Galarraga 
(dlrs 8.4 million), Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa (dlrs 8,325,000), 
New York Yankees outfielder Bernie Williams (dlrs 8.3 million) and 
Seattle outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. (dlrs 8,203,767). The median salary 
_ the point at which an equal number of players were above and below 
_ was dlrs 418,000, down from dlrs 450,000 last season and dlrs 500,000 
on opening day. Expansion and the large number of players on the disabled 
list _ 144 _ were partly responsible. The average salary was dlrs 
1,386,117, between the final figures of the players' association (dlrs 
1,398,831) and the commissioner's office (dlrs 1,380,099). Slightly 
different methods of calculation are used by each organization. Figures 
were obtained by the AP from management and player sources and include 
salaries, pro-rated shares of signing bonuses and other guaranteed 
money not attributed to a specific year, and all earned incentive 
bonuses. For some players, parts of salaries deferred without interest 
are discounted to reflect current values. Belle, who signed with Baltimore 
after the World Series, and Williams, who re-signed with the Yankees, 
will receive boosts with their new deals as will pitcher Kevin Brown, 
who agreed to a record dlrs 105 million, seven-year contract with 
the Dodgers. With the addition of Arizona and Tampa Bay as expansion 
teams, the number of millionaires was easily broken. The 326 were 
41 more than the previous mark, set in 1997. Just less than one in 
four major leaguers, 220 in all, were at dlrs 2 million or more, an 
increase of 20. There were 150 at dlrs 3 million or higher, 16 more 
than 1997, and 98 at dlrs 4 million or more, an increase of 15. At 
the highest levels, the number of dlrs 8 million players doubled from 
five to 11, a sign of the rise that's to come in future years. Baltimore, 
which had a record payroll of dlrs 75.2 million and stumbled to a 
79-83 finish, had a record 21 million-dollar players. Montreal, which 
had a payroll one-ninth of Baltimore's, had just one million-dollar 
player (Rondell White at dlrs 2 million), Florida had just two, including 
Alex Fernandez, who made dlrs 7 million and spent the entire season 
on the disabled list following rotator cuff surgery. Seventeen Marlins 
earned the minimum.
