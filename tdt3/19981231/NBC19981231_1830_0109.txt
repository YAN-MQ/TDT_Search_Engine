And this year is ending on a very cold and stormy note, with treacherous 
winter weather conditions across much of the country. NBC's Anne Thompson 
has the story. In grayling, Michigan, today, a sudden whiteout brings 
traffic to a fatal stop on I-75, 180 miles north of Detroit. Two dead, 
dozens injured, 70 motorists stranded in a 50-car pileup. Near Buffalo, 
New York, snow falls two to three inches an hour. A slower pace in 
the nation's capital, as the warmest year on record exits on a frigid 
note. An Arctic blast from Canada frosts the nation from the great 
plains to the northeast. In Boston, people walk to work in subzero 
windchills. In Detroit lake, Minnesota, ice fishermen and the Mercury 
barely move. The high, zero. A major winter storm is on its way to 
the midwest, packing a double whammy. Snow six inches to a foot and 
ice expected to cover most of Missouri, illinois and Indiana this 
weekend. Certainly, it's not the storm of the century, but certainly 
a pretty significant storm. In Indianapolis, they're already moving 
snow, clearing the streets, well aware the worst is yet to come. Anne 
Thompson, NBC news, Chicago.
