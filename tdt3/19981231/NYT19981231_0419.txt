Facing a growing chorus of concern about drug use and unsafe sex at 
the event, organizers of a hugely popular annual gay party on Fire 
Island that raises money to fight AIDS announced Thursday that they 
were abandoning the event. For the last decade and a half, the gathering, 
known as the Morning Party, has been a poignant remembrance of those 
who have died of AIDS as well as an important fund-raiser for its 
sponsor, Gay Men's Health Crisis. But recently, the Morning Party, 
a swank social event held in the summer, has become something else: 
a cause for anger between GMHC, perhaps the nation's leading AIDS 
service organization, and some gay critics who say the party has veered 
out of control. The event had also lent cachet in recent years to 
a growing number of similar parties around the nation, known as ``circuit 
parties.'' In a statement Thursday, Gay Men's Health Crisis said it 
was canceling this year's party because ``regrettably, over the past 
few years the Morning Party has become associated with alarming levels 
of recreational drug use, despite GMHC's many attempts to discourage 
drug-taking at the event.'' At last year's party, a man from Bronxville, 
N.Y., overdosed and died in the predawn hours before the party officially 
began. In 1996, a man was evacuated by helicopter after falling into 
a drug-related coma. Dozens of police officers were brought to the 
party after those incidents, prompting some in attendance to say that 
the event resembled a police state. Randy Wojcak, a former producer 
of the Morning Party, said that members of the charity's organizing 
committee met on Dec. 2. ``In previous years, the attitude was, why 
not hold the Morning Party?'' said Wojcak, a member of the committee. 
``This year, the attitude was enough was enough. How long do we have 
to take this bad press?'' The cancellation poses a critical problem 
in fund-raising for GMHC, even as contributions from other sources 
have fallen sharply _ apparently because the success of new drugs 
in controlling AIDS has led some donors to see the issue as less urgent. 
The Morning Party is the charity's second-largest fund-raiser after 
its AIDS Walk, which raises $4.5 million. In 1998, the Morning Party 
drew 4,500 people and raised about $450,000. Michelangelo Signorile, 
author of ``Life Outside'' (HarperCollins, 1997), a book critical 
of the circuit party phenomenon, said that because of the cancellation 
of the Morning Party, ``it will become more difficult for other groups 
_ in Miami, in Chicago, in Los Angeles _ to continue to host these 
circuit parties now that GMHC, the leading sponsor, has pulled away, 
because these groups around the country are also receiving this kind 
of pressure from within the gay community.'' Others doubted that the 
charity's action would slow the expansion of circuit parties, which 
can raise hundreds of thousand of dollars a night and whose tickets 
can cost $100 or more. Alan Brown, developer of a Web site called 
Electric Dreams, which reports on the circuit party scene, said: ``I 
don't see it having any effect. It's just a symbol. But now the critics, 
like Michelangelo Signorile, have consumed their sacrificial lamb.'' 
In 1997, Gay Men's Health Crisis raised more than $31 million, but 
in 1998 it raised less than $23 million, according to a senior official 
at the charity who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said 
GMHC was considering a variety of smaller fund-raising parties, probably 
on Fire Island, but no firm plans had been set. The Morning Party 
has been held on Fire Island beaches for 16 years, usually in August, 
in cooperation with a federal park agency, the Fire Island National 
Seashore. Officials of the agency could not be reached for comment, 
but some doubted whether a for-profit gay organization, indeed any 
gay group other than GMHC, could hold a similar social event. ``GMHC 
has such a good working relationship with the parks people that I 
don't see that happening,'' said Duncan Osborne, a contributing editor 
of LGNY, a Manhattan gay publication, who has written about the Morning 
Party and the circuit party scene. Howard Grossman, a physician who 
organizes the medical tent for the party, said the Morning Party would 
be impossible to replace. ``It raised a lot of money and costs almost 
nothing to run,'' he said. ``It raised something like 90 cents on 
the dollar, which is unheard of.'' Minimum ticket prices for the party 
were raised in 1998 to $100 from $75, but some contributors pay as 
much as $10,000 a ticket, he said. ``We've got to figure out some 
way of raising funds from the Fire Island community _ some of the 
richest gays in the city _ and right now I don't see how,'' Grossman 
said.
