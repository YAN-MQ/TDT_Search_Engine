French officials say every baby born in the country on New Year's 
Day - that's Friday - will receive a 100 euro savings account opened 
by the state to mark the birth of Europe's common currency. Officials 
say they anticipate about 1500 births during the 24-hour period meaning 
the plan would cost the French government about $178,000. The common 
currency, the euro, is officially being launched at midnight Brussels 
time. That would be about 23 hours universal time.
