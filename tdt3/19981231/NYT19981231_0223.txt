In 1964, Richard Sorge, the celebrated spy who provided information 
to Soviet military intelligence from his base in World War II Tokyo, 
officially became a hero of the Soviet Union. It did him no good, 
since he had been executed in Japan in 1943, but it illustrated the 
paradox of his remarkable career. After his capture by the Japanese, 
against whom he had spied, Sorge was offered to the Soviet Union in 
exchange for Japanese spies imprisoned in Russia. ``The man called 
Richard Sorge is unknown to us,'' Soviet officials replied, wanting 
nothing to do with their most important espionage agent in Asia. It 
could be said that the man called Richard Sorge has been unknown to 
most of us. But thanks to ``Stalin's Spy,'' by the British journalist 
Robert Whymant, we now know a great deal about the romantic, intelligent, 
reckless and extraordinary German communist who was one of history's 
most successful spies. That he was recognized for his accomplishments 
in Russia only 21 years after his execution is merely one of several 
paradoxes in a history that is scrupulously and readably presented 
in Whymant's book. Another is that Stalin ignored the single most 
important piece of information that it would have been possible for 
a Soviet spy to obtain: advance knowledge of Germany's plans to invade 
the Soviet Union in 1941. More important, perhaps, Sorge, though a 
pro-Soviet communist, credibly emerges in Whymant's portrayal as a 
hero, and not only to the Soviet Union. His major motivation was hatred 
of Hitler and Nazism in Germany, and his work was aimed at hastening 
their defeat. ``Certainly, Sorge's primary duty in Tokyo was to help 
the Soviet Union ward off a very real threat from Japan,'' Whymant 
writes. ``However, he saw Nazi Germany as the most evil and dangerous 
foe, not only of Russia but of civilization itself.'' Thwarted by 
Stalin's stubborn refusal to believe his warning of the German invasion, 
Sorge leaked that information to an American journalist, Joseph Newman 
of The New York Herald Tribune. He also provided information to Western 
reporters on Japan's ambitions to conquer Southeast Asia. ``Taking 
a broad strategic view, Sorge reckoned that it was imperative to alert 
the Western democracies to Japan's aggressive designs,'' Whymant concludes. 
Whymant, who spent some 20 years researching this book, tracked down 
survivors of the Tokyo espionage ring that Sorge led and made good 
use of newly opened Soviet archives to piece together the full and 
fascinating story of ``Stalin's Spy.'' Sorge was born in Baku, Azerbaijan, 
where his German father worked in the oil fields. But Sorge, whose 
mother was Russian, was taken at an early age to Germany, growing 
up in Berlin and serving as an artillery bombardier in World War I. 
Wounded and disillusioned, he returned home from the war and quickly 
became active in the Communist Party. In the mid-1920s, he was recruited 
by the Comintern, the Communist International, to become a Soviet 
agent. His first posting was Shanghai, China, during an early stage 
of the conflict between Chinese Nationalists and Communists. Among 
his closest friends was the pro-Communist American journalist Agnes 
Smedley, who introduced him to some of the people who would later 
form part of his secret circle in Tokyo, including a well-connected, 
secretly left-wing Japanese journalist named Ozaki Hotsumi. Called 
back to Moscow in 1933, Sorge was soon sent to Tokyo with instructions 
to report on Japan's intentions toward the Soviet Union in the global 
conflict already looming. Sorge returned for a time to Germany to 
establish his connections as a German journalist. His wartime service 
and his wounds served him well as he sought letters of introduction 
to German officials, including the German military attache Eugen Ott, 
who would later become Hitler's ambassador to Japan. Sorge arrived 
in Tokyo in September 1933 as an officer in the Soviet army, attached 
to the 4th Department, responsible for agents operating in foreign 
countries. During his nine years in Japan, he built a small but remarkable 
network of informers who fed Moscow an amazing stream of information. 
Whymant's account of those years is gripping and instructive, and 
not only because of Sorge's exploits in espionage. Sorge lived tempestuously 
and licentiously in Tokyo, drinking to excess, speeding around town 
on a motorcycle and pursuing Japanese and German women (including 
a visiting anti-Nazi harpsichordist named Eta Harich-Schneider). Surprisingly, 
he did not even bother much to conceal his pro-Russian and anti-Nazi 
sentiments, which seem to have been dismissed in the German Embassy 
as the quirks of a brilliant and valuable analyst of Japan. While 
a few gaps in the record remain unfilled, Whymant is able to tell 
us almost exactly how Sorge built his Tokyo network and how he obtained 
the information he passed on to the Soviet Union. A key to his success 
was his friendship with Ozaki Hotsumi, his old friend from Shanghai 
who belonged to the circle of advisers around the Japanese prime minister, 
Prince Konoye. But the most important intelligence that fell into 
Sorge's hands came from the Germans. Sorge was so trusted in the embassy 
that his good friend Ott sent him on a secret mission to Shanghai, 
giving him the German cipher tables used in communications with Berlin. 
``It stretches the imagination to suppose that these coveted keys 
were not spirited out of Japan and passed on to Moscow's code-breakers,'' 
Whymant writes. Whymant covers all of the essential questions about 
the Soviet spy's career, including Sorge's growing ambivalence toward 
the Soviet Union under Stalin and the sense he had of being trapped 
in his role. In 1937 he ignored an order to return to Moscow for consultations, 
apparently sensing that he might be imprisoned, or executed, if he 
obeyed it. Japan's counterespionage finally caught up with him in 
1942 after interrogation of a minor member of his network. After months 
of questioning, he was hanged. Had the Japanese been able to turn 
him over to the Russians, he would almost certainly have been shot, 
given Stalin's embarrassment at having ignored Sorge's information 
about Hitler's invasion plans. In other words, Whymant's portrayal 
of Sorge's life as one of tragic ambiguity is persuasive. ``Stalin's 
Spy'' is an utterly fascinating book that treats Sorge with the complexity 
that his life and career deserve. PUBLICATION NOTES: `STALIN'S SPY'
