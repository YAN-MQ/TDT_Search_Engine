Well, the college football post season is in full swing Thursday with 
four bowl games on the schedule, including one which features an undefeated 
team. Tulane was 11 and 0 going into the Liberty Bowl in Memphis, 
Tennessee against Brigham Young, but the green way was without the 
man who led the team to an undefeated year after coach Tommy Bowden 
left for Clenson. Apparently, though, they don't miss him, as Tulane 
leads by BYU 34 to 6 in the third quarter.
