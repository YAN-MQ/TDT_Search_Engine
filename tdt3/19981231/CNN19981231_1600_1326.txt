Several bowl games are on today's schedule, including Mississippi 
playing texas tech in the independence bowl. David cutcliff makes 
his head coaching debut for the rebels, taking over for Tommy tuberville 
who departed for Auburn. Ole miss comes in at 6-5. The red raiders 
are 7-4. I think this team, we can have our best game. This is our 
last opportunity to have our best game of the season. I think this 
team really wants that.
