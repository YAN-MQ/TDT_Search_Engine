Korea's continuing its drive to revive the banking industry. The government 
has already allowed the sale of Seoul Bank and has now approved Newbridge 
Capital's purchase of a 51 percent stake in Korea First Bank. North 
Korean banks have been bailed out by the government. Newbridge Capital 
is a unit of Texas Pacific Group that gained fame when it turned big 
losses of Continental Airlines to healthy profitability.
