The U.S. ambassador closed the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv on Thursday 
after receiving ``credible'' threats, an embassy spokesman said. Israeli 
police posted extra security at the Mediterranean beachfront building. 
The spokesman, Larry Schwartz, said the closure was in line with ``actions 
the U.S. government has taken in recent weeks in light of the heightened 
general threats in the region.'' U.S. diplomatic missions around the 
world have been on heightened alert since the Aug. 7 bombings of the 
U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in which 224 people were 
killed. In the Middle East, there has been growing resentment against 
the United States following the U.S. attacks on targets in Sudan and 
Afghanistan _ in retaliation for the embassy bombings _ and the U.S. 
airstrikes against Iraq earlier this month. Schwartz said a ``direct 
and credible'' threat against the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv was received 
Wednesday evening and that in response, U.S. Ambassador Ned Walker 
ordered employees not to report to work on Thursday. He would not 
elaborate on the nature of the threat, but denied a radio report that 
Walker's life had been threatened. Israel radio quoted police officials 
as saying that an anonymous caller told an embassy security agent 
on Wednesday night that the embassy would be blown up by a bomb on 
Thursday. Schwartz said the embassy was not searched. On Thursday, 
Israeli and U.S. security officials peeked into windows of cars in 
the embassy parking lot, but did not conduct thorough searches. Several 
Israeli border policemen were posted at the entrance to the embassy. 
A sign at the door informed visitors that the embassy was closed, 
but did not give an explanation. ``They just told me that they would 
be closed until after the New Year's holiday and that the embassy 
would be open Monday,'' said Shahar Yaron, a 25-year-old Tel Aviv 
resident who was trying to obtain a U.S. tourist visa. Schwartz said 
he did not know how long the embassy would be closed. The U.S. embassy 
bombings in East Africa have been blamed on suspected terrorist Osama 
Bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire. Bin Laden, who is based in Afghanistan, 
denies the charge, but says he supported the attacks. By contrast, 
Islamic militants in the Palestinians areas, particularly the Hamas 
group, have been careful not to utter threats against the United States. 
Hamas leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin has said his struggle is against Israel, 
not America.
