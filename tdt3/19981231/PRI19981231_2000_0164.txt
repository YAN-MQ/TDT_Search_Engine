In Yeoman, controversy continues over why four tourists were killed 
on Tuesday. Today, government officials interviewed the survivors 
of Yeomanese security forces and the kidnappers. Lawrence Whitehouse, 
who's wife was killed in the operation, describes how he overpowered 
one of his captors. A few minutes of firing and failing to get the 
motor working, a tourist grabbed my hand, armed with a pistol and 
indicated that we should run away. I shouted already "You killed my 
wife! You killed my wife!". I had nothing to lose. I grabbed his gun, 
his wrist, twisted it around, and it went off. Missed by a few centimeters. 
And my fellow captives came to complete the coming down of the terrorists. 
Lawrence Whitehouse.
