Speaking of basketball, the National Basketball Association Players 
Union has sent what it called its final offer to team owners with 
just eight days left before the whole season could be lost. Union 
director Billy Hunter wants to present the offer to the owners' negotiating 
committee, however, that might not be possible before the so-called 
drop dead date of January 7th. Commissioner Stern has said if the 
players brought a reasonable offer, he would present it to the negotiating 
committee. The owners locked players out in July in a dispute over 
revenue sharing. The owners say the players are making more money 
than the league can afford, but the players want to earn as much as 
possible.
