Angered by a landmark court ruling undercutting the status of Orthodox 
rabbis, religious lawmakers said Thursday they would rush a bill through 
parliament granting the Orthodox establishment the sole right to perform 
conversions to Judaism. On Wednesday, the Jerusalem District Court 
ruled that all Conservative and Reform converts to Judaism must be 
recognized as Jews in Israel. The ruling broke new ground by validating 
conversion by non-Orthodox movements in Israel as well as abroad. 
Earlier Israeli court rulings had recognized only the validity of 
non-Orthodox conversions performed abroad. The Reform and Conservative 
movements are more liberal streams of Judaism and have been fighting 
for recognition in Israel where Orthodox rabbis still control religious 
affairs. Orthodox religious leader were outraged by the court ruling. 
``If the court wants to declare a war with us, we will answer with 
war,'' legislator Shlomo Ben-Izry from the religious Shas Party told 
Israel TV's Channel Two. Legislator Hanan Porat said that in response 
to the court ruling, he would accelerate passage of a bill encoding 
the Orthodox monopoly on conversions into law. Porat is a member of 
the National Religious Party and chairman of the Law Committee. Porat 
said his committee would hear the legislation Monday. It was not immediately 
clear whether the bill would have a majority in the 120-member parliament. 
The Knesset winter session ends in March, two months before new elections. 
Candidates for prime minister would likely try to avoid alienating 
religious lawmakers so close to an election because their support 
is considered important for future coalition building. In addition 
to the planned legislation, the Interior Ministry said it would appeal 
the court ruling to the Supreme Court. In his ruling Wednesday, Jerusalem 
District Court Judge Vardi Zyler said that 22 Reform and one Conservative 
convert must be listed in the Israeli population registry as Jews. 
Of the 23 converts, 13 were converted in Israel and the others abroad. 
Reform Jewish leader Rabbi Uri Regev warned Orthodox Jewish politicians 
not to try to overturn the ruling with legislation. Regev, who called 
the ruling ``revolutionary,'' said that Jews belonging to the Reform 
and Conservative movement in the United States _ the largest Jewish 
community in the world, and where those two movements predominate 
_ would regard a challenge as a ``personal insult'' and might stop 
backing Israel. He said attempts by Orthodox parties to force their 
version of Judaism on all of Israel are seen by American Jews as ``slapping 
Reform and Conservative Judaism in the face, questioning their integrity, 
questioning their Jewish identity.'' American Jews have contributed 
hundreds of millions of dollars to Israel and are instrumental in 
promoting Israel's interests before the American government. In recent 
years, as the Orthodox Jews gain more power in Israel, there have 
been signs of alienation. American Jews have been earmarking a larger 
portion of their contributions for their own communities instead of 
Israel. Israel's Orthodox Jewish establishment rejects the Reform 
and Conservative movements because they do not follow the strict religious 
laws and interpretations that govern the lives of the Orthodox.
