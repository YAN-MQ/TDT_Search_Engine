The Denver Broncos football team finally corralled the elusive National 
Football League championship in 1998, while two teams earned the right 
to claim the U.S. National College Football title. VOA's Jim Stevenson 
has more on the big gridiron winners of the past year. Football fans 
in Denver began 1998 with a dose of redemption. They put years of 
championship frustration behind them in January when the Broncos won 
Super Bowl XXXII. Denver had reached and lost the title game in four 
other seasons, three of those with John Elway as quarterback. But 
Elway led the Broncos past the defending Super Bowl champion Green 
Bay Packers 31 to 24 to exorcise the demons of his football past. 
It's indescribable. You can't put words to it because you work so 
hard to get to this game. And to finally come out as champs, it's 
unbelievable. This is the ultimate win, but this one erases those 
other three. The prolific passer had some extra power on the ground 
for a change. Denver running back Terrell Davis rushed for 157 yards 
and a Super Bowl record three touchdowns on his way to the Most Valuable 
Player award. Wearing championship rings, the Broncos have continued 
their success as few other teams have. The Broncos won 13 straight 
games to tie the 1934 Chicago Bears and 1972 Miami Dolphins. Other 
teams looking toward the playoffs and a chance to play in Super Bowl 
XXXIII in Miami are the Minnesota Vikings, San Francisco 49ers, Jacksonville 
Jaguars, and Dallas Cowboys. The Falcons in Atlanta and the New York 
Jets suddenly gained altitude in 1998 as both teams flew high and 
fast toward the playoffs.
