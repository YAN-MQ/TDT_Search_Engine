Hi, I'm Jesa Polacka from Bokas, South Africa of the BBC World Service 
and I'd like to say, which means Happy New Year 1999. You're listening 
to PRI, Public Radio International. The World is sponsored by the 
Capital Group Companies investing throughout the world for individuals 
and institutions. And The World is sponsored by Merck, dedicated to 
the needs of society through pharmaceutical research and consumer 
education to improve the quality of life. Merck committed to brining 
out the best in medicine. This is the World. I'm Lisa Mullins.
