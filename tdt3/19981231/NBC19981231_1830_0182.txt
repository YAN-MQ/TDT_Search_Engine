We also have an incredible survival story tonight. High in the Colorado 
Rockies, a sudden storm caused a small plane to crash. The three people 
on board survived but feared they would not be found for days. But, 
as NBC's Roger O'Neill reports tonight, that's when luck became a 
Major factor. The winds were still howling, up to 100 miles an hour, 
when the last of the three survivors, the pilot, were brought off 
the 12,000-foot mountain, all lucky to be alive. Luck is how Frank 
maricks saw the plane going down and heard the crash. We got a dirty 
snowman here. He happened to be cross-country skiing in the middle 
of colorado's wilderness. He was only 100 feet above the treetop. 
I thought to myself that this is certainly going to crash. He found 
the plane, then directed rescuers to the exact spot where it crashed. 
The Colorado mountains are very unforgiving, especially in winter. 
For small planes, strong winds make this a high-risk state to fly 
in. But, clearly, lady luck was shining Wednesday. The Colorado air 
patrol says, in the last two years, no one has survived a Crash here. 
But on this flight, three survivors and a cell phone that worked to 
911. Rollins pass is on the continental divide. It's always tricky 
to fly over, and the pilot, gert eberlein, had never done it before. 
We got caught in a downdraft. There was nothing to decide, just going 
straight between the trees. Rebecca Rudd and her daughter, Natasha, 
were passengers on the plane. Somebody was definitely watching out 
for us. To walk out of something like that and not really be too hurt 
is really amazing. Rescuers say it would have taken them hours, perhaps 
days to find the downed plane, if it hadn't been for the cross-country 
skier who just happened to be in the right place at the right time.
