Seven out of ten Russian don't expect their lives to improve in 1999, 
despite the government's pledge to resurrect the economy after a devastating 
financial crisis, according to a poll released Monday. Eighteen percent 
of the 6,000 people surveyed by the Institute of Parliamentary Sociology 
said they expected some improvement in their lives, while 12 percent 
couldn't predict, the Interfax news agency reported. But 70 percent 
of those polled across Russia said their living situation wouldn't 
get better in the upcoming year. The report gave no margin of error 
for the poll. Respondents said the were most likely to worry about 
wage arrears and low salaries in 1999. They were also afraid that 
health care and other social services would fall further into neglect. 
Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the government has had trouble 
paying wages and pensions on time. The education and health care systems 
have also been extremely hard hit. These problems have been exacerbated 
by the country's latest economic crisis, which hit in August.
