Voters in this rocket-plagued border town wanted answers Thursday 
from Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the man who would be prime minister. Instead, 
they got dollops of his famous charm. It wasn't enough for Kiryat 
Shemona residents _ or, according to a new poll showing plummeting 
ratings for the just-retired military chief-of-staff, an electorate 
that is already wearying in a personality-driven campaign in its early 
days. In the market place of Kiryat Shemona, a town hit hard last 
week by Lebanese guerrilla rockets, Lipkin-Shahak frustrated vendors 
with his vague answers to questions about his policies on Lebanon. 
``What will do you do for Kiryat Shemona?'' asked shopper Linda Attal. 
``Whatever I can,'' replied Lipkin-Shahak. Moshe Dadon, a vegetables 
vendor, told Lipkin-Shahak that the killing of Israel soldiers in 
Lebanon must stop. ``That's right,'' the candidate replied. Such non-commital 
answers frustrated Motti Avizada. ``Shahak _ that's all we hear,'' 
Avizada said. ``We don't know what he stands for. He himself doesn't 
know what he stands for.'' After Lipkin-Shahak spoke at Tel Hai teachers 
training college, a student joked to his friends: ``Besides nothing, 
he didn't say anything.'' A poll published the same day Lipkin-Shahak 
made his first campaign stop toward May elections indicated that he 
is losing the luster he maintained until last week, when he shed his 
uniform. The Maariv/Gallup poll showed Lipkin-Shahak would win 17 
percent of the vote in a first round of voting _ not enough to get 
into a run-off phase. The poll, of 562 voting-age Israelis, had a 
margin of error of 4.5 percent. Until last week, Shahak scored in 
the 30s _ often outdoing his principal rivals, Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu and Labor party leader Ehud Barak. Shahak had a period of 
grace because as a soldier he was prohibited from expressing opinions. 
Out of uniform, Israelis expect clear-cut policies on the security 
issues that grip the country. Netanyahu has made it clear that he 
will only grudgingly concede land to the Arabs; Barak says he is ready 
to stand by Israeli commitments to do so. Lipkin-Shahak has yet to 
commit either way, a lack of identification he hopes will help him. 
``I'm accused of being a neophyte in politics,'' he told reporters. 
``I don't consider this an insult if it is in contrast to political 
sharks,'' an allusion to the mudslinging that has marked this campaign. 
But some see his broad-based approach as opportunism. Daniel Doron, 
a political commentator writing in The Jerusalem Post, chided him 
for not being ``embarrassed at trying to piece together a party with 
candidates whose positions are known to be worlds apart.'' Doron noted 
that Lipkin-Shahak's tour as chief-of-staff was marked by military 
failures in Lebanon _ a record his rivals are sure to exploit as the 
May 17 vote nears. Lipkin-Shahak, sporting a windbreaker, exhibited 
much of the charm that earned him a following during his tenure as 
chief-of-staff. He cocked his head attentively toward questioners 
and always marked his reply with a broad smile. It worked for some. 
``I think he's a very talented man and well-suited to politics,'' 
said Michal Saadia, a shopper. She added, ``He's gorgeous.'' Others, 
Lipkin-Shahak left anxious. ``I want to hear this guy talk more, I 
don't know what he believes in,'' said Assaf Rashba, a Tel Hai student, 
as he sat down to hear Lipkin-Shahak speak. . ``I still don't know 
what he believes,'' Rashba said, leaving the hall. ``I'm quite disappointed.''
