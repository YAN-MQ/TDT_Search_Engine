The Connecticut Council of Small Towns faxed the alarm to its 85 members 
late last week, contending that Gov. John Rowland was about to cut 
tens of millions of dollars in aid to municipalities in the two-year 
state budget he is to present in early February. The bulletin suggested 
that the cost of building a football stadium for the New England Patriots 
was already coming home to roost, and begged mayors and selectmen 
to band together to ``fend off the governor's budget ax.'' The governor's 
office scoffed at the message, asserting that budget decisions would 
not be made until late January. But the fax, labeled ``Breaking News,'' 
exposed a growing sense of foreboding among those who depend on state 
aid. Until the stadium came along, the towns, schools and a wide variety 
of social service programs stood to benefit from the windfall produced 
by a sizzling economy. Now, advocates for these causes fear that a 
huge tab for the stadium could mean lean times elsewhere. Depending 
on which legislator is doing the figuring, the stadium will cost the 
state at least $100 million and perhaps as much as $1 billion over 
the life of the 30-year lease, which the state Legislature overwhelmingly 
approved during a special session two weeks ago. It is partly that 
uncertainty that has local governments, children's groups and others 
fretting about how tightly the state has tied its hands with what 
many people consider a generous offer to lure the National Football 
League team from the Boston region to downtown Hartford. Dannel Malloy, 
the mayor of Stamford, said the decision on the Patriots had been 
made so hastily that residents of his city and the towns near the 
New York border were left wondering what _ if any _ benefits the huge 
investment would have for them. ``In this part of the state, the impact 
of the stadium is at the very least not understood, but is looked 
at with some fear and trepidation on the state's ability to fund other 
programs,'' he said. But because the stadium is a pet project of both 
the governor, who is a Republican, and the Legislature's leaders, 
who are Democrats, Malloy and others who need favors in Hartford are 
reluctant to attack the deal, which they consider water over the dam. 
``It's an issue to be managed around, at this point,'' the mayor said. 
So it is the delicate issue of what taxpayers really gave up to get 
the Patriots that will help drive the state's political dialogue beginning 
on Wednesday, when the Legislature will open its annual session and 
Rowland will be inaugurated for a second term. Some groups are already 
looking for ways to use the issue to their advantage. Janice Gruendel, 
executive director of Connecticut Voices for Children, which focuses 
on issues like day care and health insurance, said the season's hot 
new term was ``stadium guilt'' _ a hope among some advocates that 
lawmakers would be more generous to social service programs as a way 
of compensating for what many see as a huge gift to the Patriots. 
``Legislators were not all equally comfortable voting for the stadium, 
and when they voted for it, they knew the state had other needs,'' 
Ms. Gruendel said. ``We believe the state has the capacity to make 
the same dollar choice for kids and families that it did for football.'' 
The state's lieutenant governor, M. Jodi Rell, who was the governor's 
running mate, said she recognized that the administration's critics 
would try to use the stadium issue against Rowland. But she said the 
stadium and other programs had ``absolutely no correlation, and should 
not be confused.'' ``This may be an easy target, but it should not 
be a license for people to complain that their particular project 
is not being funded,'' she said. ``It could be said about any other 
project. If someone didn't get a sewer project, did they point their 
finger and say, `It's because you funded the University of Connecticut'?'' 
Although Connecticut will pay for most of the stadium by selling bonds, 
legislative leaders have agreed to use $100 million of this year's 
budget surplus as a down payment on the $375 million construction 
cost. In addition, the Legislature's Office of Fiscal Analysis estimates 
that interest on the bonds will cost $212 million over 30 years. A 
10 percent tax on Patriots tickets will help pay the cost. Linda Miller, 
principal analyst at the Office of Fiscal Analysis, said the real 
cost might be in the other projects that cannot be undertaken because 
of the heavy debt that the stadium will put on the books of the state, 
whose credit rating is already below average because of its debt load. 
``If they have to do less bonding for other purposes because of the 
stadium, that means the stadium will be taking up money that could 
have been used for schools, prisons or whatever,'' she said. Estimates 
of the state's surplus from this year's budget range from $350 million 
to $500 million, and many state supplicants had hoped that money would 
go toward their wish lists. For instance, the Connecticut Conference 
of Municipalities, which represents cities and towns, has issued a 
study concluding that its members will need $2.8 billion over the 
next 25 years to improve waste-water treatment plants in order to 
meet new requirements intended to clean up Long Island Sound. The 
group's president, John Weichsel, the town manager of Southington, 
said he also hoped that the economic boom would allow the state to 
upgrade its schools, pipes and roads. ``If we're ever going to improve 
these things, this is the time to take a quantum leap,'' he said. 
Kevin Sullivan, the Senate president pro tempore and a strong supporter 
of the stadium, said new programs would be financed if they made sense, 
but not to make up for money going to the Patriots. ``I don't have 
stadium guilt,'' he said. ``I have stadium pride.''
