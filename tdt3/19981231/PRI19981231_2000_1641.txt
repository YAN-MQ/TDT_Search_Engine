Hello, I'm Marina Strolonic in Moscow, Russia. Happy New Year! This 
is PRI, Public Radio International. I'm Lisa Mullins. Still to come 
on the World: retracting President Clinton's Africa trip and reconsidering 
who owns the remains of an indigenous Finnish people. There's something 
missing if the sacred places are empty, if the graveyards are empty, 
if the bodies, the bones -skeletons have been removed from our graveyards. 
First though, this news.
