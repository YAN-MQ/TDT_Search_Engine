Liberated at last from a life of revolution, two Khmer Rouge leaders 
came to this beach resort Thursday with their families, their leisure 
wear and their sunglasses. But their holiday was a drab one, spent 
mostly behind the dirty brown curtains of their tiny hotel rooms, 
trapped inside by their fear of a small group of reporters. ``Right 
now, His Excellency wants to relax,'' an aide, Long Norin, said, explaining 
the strange behavior of the former Khmer Rouge head of state, Khieu 
Samphan, 67, who came here with Nuon Chea, 71, the chief ideologue 
of the Khmer Rouge revolution. Even the men's two grown daughters 
and one teen-age granddaughter spent the sunny afternoon in their 
darkened room watching a Thai television station. After about six 
hours of this _ during which a waiter brought seafood lunches to the 
two leaders' rooms _ and after reporters assured an aide that they 
would be polite, the two men emerged, said a few innocuous words and 
took a brief tour of the city. ``I'm fine; I just need to rest a little 
bit,'' Khieu Samphan said as he walked past a plastic Santa Claus 
pasted to the hotel's glass door. ``I have already said what I have 
to say.'' At a rowdy news conference Tuesday, the two men had pleaded 
to ``let bygones be bygones'' but were overwhelmed by aggressive questions 
about their roles as leaders of a brutal government that caused more 
than 1 million deaths from 1975 to 1979. ``They're going to start 
a riot!'' Nuon Chea exclaimed as security men bundled him past reporters 
after the Tuesday news conference. The scene was calmer Thursday at 
the three-story Seaside Hotel, 100 yards from the beach, where the 
hum of air conditioners was almost the only sound in the empty courtyard. 
As the sun began to sink, sparkling off the sea, the old men napped 
or watched television in their darkened rooms. The duty manager, Son 
Cha, said it was a little unusual but not unheard-of that the group 
had spent the entire sunny afternoon without going out. ``They don't 
like to go out because they don't know how many people like them and 
how many people don't like them,'' he said. ``But all the people don't 
like them.'' Son Cha noted that they had not tipped the bellboy when 
they arrived. Dy Mary, 18, a receptionist, said she did not know too 
much about her famous guests. ``I heard their names in school, but 
I wasn't born yet when those things happened,'' she said. ``I'm not 
angry at them because they didn't do anything to me.'' She said her 
parents had told her that the Khmer Rouge years had been difficult 
but did not elaborate. She added, ``We welcome anyone to our hotel 
as long as they pay.'' The Khmer Rouge tour of the city took a little 
more than an hour. In four vans escorted by two trucks of soldiers 
armed with automatic weapons and rocket launchers, they drove past 
the beach, through the pothole-riddled town center, into the port, 
out past the beach again and back to their hotel and their $30 rooms 
adorned with red plastic tulips. ``There have been a lot of changes,'' 
Khieu Samphan said of the city. ``It makes me understand a lot of 
issues better, especially visiting places I haven't seen in a long 
time.'' He did not elaborate. By 9 p.m. the holiday makers had eaten 
again, returned to their rooms and turned on their tiny television 
sets in the silent and half-empty hotel, awaiting the new year without 
celebration. A security man assigned by the government to accompany 
them said they had had a better time on Wednesday when they toured 
the capital, Phnom Penh, after being welcomed by Prime Minister Hun 
Sen on Tuesday. Their defections last Friday marked the collapse of 
the last group of Khmer Rouge holdouts. But their official welcome 
and the apparent decision by Hun Sen not to turn them over for trial 
has raised questions about justice and impunity after one of history's 
great atrocities. Wednesday, as the group drove past landmarks that 
had been damaged by the Khmer Rouge, the wife of Nuon Chea, a talkative 
woman, exclaimed, ``Oh, we shouldn't have done that,'' said the security 
man, who insisted that his name not be used. He said Khieu Samphan 
replied, ``Oh, all that was done by Comrade Son Sen,'' another top 
leader who was killed in June 1997 in a rift with the Khmer Rouge 
founder, Pol Pot, who himself died in April 1998. The security man, 
who had become quite friendly with his charges, said he then told 
the Khmer Rouge leaders, ``Cambodia would have developed fast in 1975 
if you had not killed so many people.'' He said Ieng Sary, another 
high-ranking defector who was in the car with them, replied, ``We 
made mistakes by going the Communist route.'' The guard said he himself 
then made a pun, playing on the word ``Communist,'' saying, ``Not 
all `kumunus' is bad.'' ``Kumunus'' is the word in the Khmer language 
for ``revenge.'' He said everybody laughed. The guard said that like 
virtually all Cambodians of his generation he had lost several family 
members in the years his new friends had ruled the country. Did it 
not bother him to be joking with some of the top architects of that 
bloodshed? The security man answered with another joke. ``Let bygones 
be bygones,'' he said, and laughed.
