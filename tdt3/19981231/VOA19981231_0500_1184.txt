The Washington Huskies have fired head coach Jim Lambright just five 
days after his Huskies team lost to Air Force in the Oahu Bowl. Lambright 
has been associated with the Washington program for 30 years. His 
team's 45 to 25 loss to Air Force left Washington with a record of 
6 and 6 this season, its first nonwinning season in 22 years. Lambright 
says that he will always carry the memories of his time at Washington 
with him. I will leave this program with my head up knowing that I 
didn't bow to anybody on the outside as far as making my decisions, 
as far as who I hire, who I get rid of, who I think is competent, 
who is not, and how I think this program is going to get better. Lambright 
compiled a record of 44 wins, 25 losses and one draw in six years 
as the team's head coach.
