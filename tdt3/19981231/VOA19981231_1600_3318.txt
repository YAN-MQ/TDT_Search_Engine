In college football, two schools shared the final number one ranking 
for the third time in the decade. The Michigan Wolverines defeated 
Washington State 21 to 16 in January's Rose Bowl to finish undefeated 
in 12 games and claim the national championship in the Associated 
Press poll. Quarterback Brian Greacy and the rest of the team realized 
the significance of the season. In the past 50 years, no Michigan 
team has won a national championship, and this was an opportunity 
for us. And each of guys realized that, and it's just sweet for us 
to be able to capitalize on an opportunity that we had to make history.
