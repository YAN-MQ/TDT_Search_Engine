It San Francisco now, police uncovered what they describe as significant 
information and material which add up to a bomb making operation. 
Here is ABC's Brian Rooney. a pacific gas and electric spokesman said 
that at 7:00 this morning one of their building inspectors was looking 
for a water leak when he opened a locker and found several bags of 
ammonium nitrate. There's no doubt in my mind that it's not PG&E material. 
We don't use that kind of stuff. Ammonium nitrate is the same kind 
of fertilizer used to make the bomb that blew up the Murrah federal 
building in Oklahoma City. Federal agents quickly joined today's investivagtion. 
Officers said they found about 250 pounds of ammonium nitrate and 
other chemicals, along with bomb making literature and a small quantity 
of what they call prepared explosive material. If we speculate the 
250 pounds of ammonium nitrate, if it was chemically mixed properly 
it could have easily blown up a large portion of this building. But 
there was no bomb threat or actual bomb set to go off. Police said 
they would interview some of the people who worked in the building. 
This afternoon, they had taken into custody and were questioning an 
employee they described as a suspect. Brian Rooney, ABC News, Los 
Angeles.
