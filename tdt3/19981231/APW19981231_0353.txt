Reflecting divided Arab opinions, a leading Egyptian cleric harshly 
criticized Iraqi President Saddam Hussein while Jordanian demonstrators 
urged lifting U.N. sanctions on Iraq. Sheik Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, 
head of Sunni Islam's leading center of religious study, Al-Azhar, 
accused Saddam of using his power for ``evil and betrayal.'' The remark, 
printed Thursday in the pro-government daily Al-Ahram, comes amid 
a trading of insults in the Egyptian and Iraqi press after Egypt's 
President Hosni Mubarak criticized Saddam earlier this week. ``A leader 
like Saddam Hussein, who used his forces for evil and betrayal in 
an arrogant way, should not be sweet-talked or appeased by anyone,'' 
Tantawi was quoted as saying. Al-Ahram said he spoke Wednesday to 
the Kuwaiti-Egyptian Friendship Association. It was Iraq's 1990 invasion 
of Kuwait the divided the Arab world into pro- and anti-Iraq sides 
and set off the Gulf War. Tantawi also was quoted as expressing sorrow 
for the plight of the Iraqi people whom he said ``have suffered and 
were distressed because of the wars and injustices that afflicted 
them.'' In the Jordanian capital Amman, meanwhile, about 200 people 
demonstrated near the U.S. Embassy after being prevented from reaching 
the embassy itself by some 600 anti-riot police. ``We want to announce 
that we do not want to see any American here,'' the crowd chanted, 
protesting the U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq in mid-December. 
The demonstrators demanded an immediate halt to U.N. Security sanctions 
on Iraq _ imposed after the invasion of Kuwait _ and shouted support 
for Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident blamed for bombing attacks 
on U.S. embassies in Africa last August. ``We are trying to express 
our views against the massacre of the Iraqi people and, as you see, 
we are forbidden from doing so,'' said opposition figure Toujan Faisal, 
pointing at police blocking the road to the embassy. Jordanian officials 
had said earlier they would ban the protest since Iraqi officials 
had planned to attend. But police made no move to stop the protest, 
only kept it away from the embassy. The crowd dispersed peacefully 
in under an hour.
