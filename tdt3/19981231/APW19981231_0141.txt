Frustrated by fierce winds in the Australian Outback, a U.S.-Australian 
team trying fly nonstop around the world was forced on Thursday to 
cancel their latest scheduled launch date. Mission control director 
Dan Pedersen said winds on New Year's Day were forecast to be too 
strong at 900 ft. _ the height the balloon will ascend to during launch 
_ for a safe launch. ``We are going to target the morning of the 2nd 
(of January),'' Pedersen said. Team leader and Denver real estate 
magnate Dave Liniger said he and his co-pilots, Albuquerque-based 
journalist Bob Martin and Australian balloonist John Wallington, were 
anxious to get off the ground. ``We want to go,'' Liniger said. ``It's 
possible that the longer we wait, the worse the weather will get and 
we will end up wasting millions of dollars and a lot of people's time.'' 
The Re/Max International team has a weather ``window'' in which to 
take off lasting from late December to mid-January. After that, high 
altitude winds that blow directly from east to west at speeds needed 
to power the balloon's initial stage of flight will shift direction. 
The team expects to succeed where other attempts have failed by rising 
to the edge of the atmosphere on a route which follows the Tropic 
of Capricorn. On Thursday, scientists and engineers endured another 
day working on the balloon's spaceship-like capsule in searing temperatures 
of around 100 F (38 C) at the garage-like workshop in the desert of 
central Australia. Pedersen said the team had been ready to launch 
from a technical standpoint, but that he was happy the weather afforded 
more time to work on the capsule and run more tests. ``I'm not disappointed,'' 
said Pedersen, a former U.S. Navy captain and jet fighter test pilot. 
``I wanted another 16 or so hours of tests and final crew training. 
``We will take advantage of every moment the wind is unfortunately 
giving us.'' Weight distribution problems were identified Wednesday, 
when the capsule was lifted by crane off the ground for the first 
time. Electronic control boards were installed Thursday, including 
switching systems which will run programs such as explosive bolts 
to cut the capsule free in an emergency. Final procedures including 
attaching the solar panels which will power the craft were scheduled 
to take place on Friday. The pilots will hang below a balloon made 
of lunchwrap-thin polyethylene plastic in a 7-ft. by 8-ft. (2.1-meter 
by 2.4-meter) capsule packed with life-support systems, scientific 
equipment, food, waste disposal units and cameras and communications 
gear. When fully inflated, the balloon is 460 feet (138 meters) in 
diameter and 700 feet (210 meters) high _ large enough to envelope 
the Houston Astrodome or two 747 jet liners nose-to-nose. It will 
rise 1,000 feet (300 meters) a minute during takeoff, expanding on 
the way up with 170,000 cubic ft. (5,100 cubic meters) of helium. 
It will rise into the stratosphere to a cruising altitude of 130,000 
feet (39,000 meters), or about 24 miles (39 kilometers) above sea 
level. That's higher than any previous manned balloon flight. The 
pilots will wear Russian-made space suits during parts of the journey 
where the atmosphere outside will be less than 1 percent of that at 
sea level. After a round of meetings earlier Thursday closed to all 
but core team members, Wallington said delays were adding to tension 
surrounding the launch. ``It's not nerve-wracking because there is 
so much to do, but I am a little anxious to get going,'' Wallington 
said. The team's bid comes just days after a failed attempt by Chicago 
millionaire Steve Fossett, British millionaire Richard Branson and 
Per Lindstrand of Sweden.
