This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for Friday, the first day of 1999. A strong storm will develop 
through the southern plain states with a Secondary low pressure center 
over the northern plains, so we'll see snow across much of the central 
U.S. changing to rain in the lower Mississippi river valley. Snow 
showers will move from the Great Lakes across New England overnight. 
And we'll see some rain or snow in the northwest as well. High temperatures 
on Friday will still be mild in the southwest, but they will be subzero 
or single numbers in the upper midwest and northern sections of New 
England, and feel even colder than that if you take wind chills into 
account. Looking ahead to Saturday, look for heavy snow, ice, and 
rain across much of the country from the Great Lakes to the gulf coast 
with cold temperatures. On Sunday, those temperatures drop even farther 
southward as our mix of rain and snow moves into New England. For 
Monday, snow showers northeast, rain and snow showers northwest, and 
still pretty cold, except for the southwest. Don't forget, four-day 
forecasts for more than 7,200 cities at CNN.com.
