Russian inflation, which appeared under control until a financial 
crisis hit last summer, reached 84 percent for all of 1998, the government 
said Thursday. With Russia still mired in crisis, many private economists 
expect the rate for 1999 to be as high, if not higher. In preparing 
the 1999 federal budget, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government 
has forecast inflation at 30 percent, but many analysts regard this 
as overly optimistic. Russia suffered from hyperinflation for several 
years after it moved to a market economy in 1992, but the government 
seemed to be taming inflation in recent years. The rate was 11 percent 
in 1997 and the government was expecting single-digit inflation for 
1998 until the financial crisis struck in August. Since then, the 
Russian currency has lost much of its value, the government has effectively 
defaulted on some of its debts and the economy has been shrinking. 
The economy contracted about 5 percent in 1998 and Russia remained 
trapped in one of the worst depressions ever experienced by an industrialized 
nation. Primakov warned government bureaucrats Thursday that their 
salaries would not be increased until the incomes of the country's 
poorest citizens began rising. ``I don't think ... it would be correct 
to raise salaries for ourselves without raising the salaries of the 
poorest citizens,'' Primakov said. ``We cannot turn Russia into an 
economically prosperous country in just a few months, but it's our 
duty to do as much as possible,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax 
news agency. An estimated 42 million Russians, nearly one-third of 
the entire population, is living below the official poverty line, 
the government said recently. Meanwhile, a Russian court has declared 
bankrupt what was one of the country's largest banks, clearing the 
way for the first liquidation of a major bank since the August crisis. 
The Moscow Arbitration Court ruled this week that Tokobank was bankrupt 
and that its assets should be distributed among creditors, The Moscow 
Times reported. The bank was once among the 20 largest in Russia, 
but now has debts of 7.5 billion rubles (dlrs 363 million) and assets 
of just 3.4 billion rubles (dlrs 165 million), the newspaper reported. 
Russia has some 1,500 banks, but many have been hard hit by the financial 
crisis and have either closed or are providing only limited services. 
In another development, the Central Bank said Russia's hard currency 
reserves stood at dlrs 12.3 billion as of Dec. 25. Central Bank Chairman 
Viktor Gerashchenko said in a television interview Wednesday the reserves 
had dipped to dlrs 11 billion. But he was apparently referring to 
outdated figures, a Central Bank spokesman said Thursday.
