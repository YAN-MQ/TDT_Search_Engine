The fourth quarter of 1998, when ``technology'' and ``Internet'' were 
synonymous with almost instant paper wealth and the stock market staged 
as stunning a turnaround as any in recent memory, left many professionals 
rubbing their eyes in disbelief. ``I can't explain it other than to 
say it is irrational exuberance,'' said Chuck Hill, director of research 
at First Call. ``It is momentum investing, and there is no logic to 
it.'' But there was some logic to why stocks rose from an apparent 
abyss to solid double-digit gains for the year. On Oct. 1, when financial 
markets appeared on the verge of imploding, the Dow Jones industrial 
average fell by more than 210 points and closed less than 100 points 
above 7,539.07, the low it hit on Aug. 31. Since then, foreign markets 
have staged a comeback. The steep slide in U.S. stock prices was seen 
by many as a buying opportunity. Third-quarter earnings were not as 
bad as expected. Perhaps most important, the Federal Reserve Board 
and more than 50 central banks around the world have cut interest 
rates. ``This was a liquidity-driven market,'' said Byron Wien, chief 
U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. 
``The world was awash in it.'' The decline in interest rates not only 
helped to revive Wall Street's badly shaken psyche, but also propelled 
the three most widely watched market indexes _the Dow, the Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite _ to new highs during the 
quarter. The gains for those measures were undeniably impressive. 
The Dow rose 17 percent during the quarter. The S&AMP;P's 500-stock 
index gained nearly 21 percent, its second-best quarter ever. And 
the Nasdaq, weighted heavily with technology company stocks, performed 
amazingly, rising 29.45 percent, just shy of its best quarter ever. 
The strong finish accounted for most of the market's double-digit 
gains for the year. For all of 1998, the Dow rose 16.1 percent; the 
S&AMP;P 500 was up 26.67 percent, and the Nasdaq jumped 39.63 percent. 
But, as was true for most of the year, a mere handful of stocks accounted 
for most of the market's strength in the fourth quarter. The Russell 
2000 index of small-company stocks rebounded from Oct. 8, when it 
closed at 310.28. But the index never came close to regaining the 
peak of 491.41 it hit on April 21 and finished at 421.96, down 3.4 
percent for the year. ``If you look at the four major indexes _ the 
Dow, the S&AMP;P, Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange composite 
_ two of them have Intel, Cisco Systems, MCI Worldcom, Lucent Technologies 
and Dell Computer,'' said Walter Murphy, a senior market analyst at 
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``This is a very, very narrow market,'' he 
said. ``To me that suggests there is a case to be made that once this 
rally is over, the market will go through a reasonably substantial 
retracement.'' Those five stocks, among the biggest and most widely 
traded, did extremely well. Intel, for example, which started the 
quarter at 85 3/4, closed Thursday at 118 9/16, up 38.3 percent. Cisco, 
at 61 13/16 at the end of September, finished the year at 92 13/16, 
a gain of 50.8 percent. And Lucent Technologies moved from 69 1/16 
to 109 15/16 Thursday, up 59.2 percent. However, while technology 
stocks in general and Internet stocks in particular grabbed the headlines, 
they were not the S&AMP;P 500's best-performing group during the quarter. 
Transportation issues, battered earlier in the year, gained that distinction, 
followed by investment banking and brokerage stocks and apparel retailers. 
Not surprisingly, the steep decline in oil prices hurt energy stocks, 
particularly oil-service and production companies. Of the four worst-performing 
groups in the S&AMP;P 500, these stocks occupied three of the slots. 
Only gold stocks did worse. Among the Dow stocks, none did better 
than Wal-Mart Stores, which rose 49 percent in the quarter. And none 
did worse than Eastman Kodak, which fell 6.3 percent despite strong 
competition from Boeing, which dropped 4.9 percent, and Sears, Roebuck, 
down 3.8 percent. Then there were the Internet stocks. It is hard 
to imagine, let alone explain, the rise in a stock like Ebay. The 
online auction house, which went public in mid-September at 18 a share 
and was trading at just more than 45 on Sept. 30, finished the year 
at 241 1/4, a gain of about 435 percent overall. Amazon.com did not 
do badly, either. The online book, tape and video retailer purveyor 
started the quarter at 111 5/8. It closed Thursday at 321 1/4, for 
a jump of 187.8 percent. For the quarter, the 50 stocks that make 
up Interactive Week's Internet Index _ a list that does not include 
stocks that have not been publicly traded for less than six months 
_ posted a gain of 71.4 percent. The golden touch of the Internet 
seemed to reach nearly any company that operated a Web site. Charles 
Schwab, the brokerage house that does a lot of business online, was 
the best-performing stock in the S&AMP;P 500 index for the quarter. 
Earlier in the week, its market capitalization rose above that of 
Merrill Lynch, a far bigger, more diversified enterprise. Few expect 
the current mania to continue. But the excitement generated among 
investors by the Internet's potential is justified, analysts said. 
``The Internet is the most exciting business phenomenon since the 
airplane or television,'' Wien of Morgan Stanley said. ``It is truly 
a dramatic life-changing event, an open-ended situation investors 
have not been confronted with for some time. To say that this is a 
fad is an easy trap to fall into. But this is bigger than that.''
