This is VOA News Now. I'm Tony Riggs broadcasting to you from Washington. 
Have you talked about your child's health today? Millions of children 
are dying or severely disabled not from war or drugs, but from a less 
noticeable threat: malnutrition. Malnutrition can cause intellectual 
or physical defects and make it harder for a child to fight off illness. 
Awareness about malnutrition must begin before a child is born. Expectant 
mothers should discuss the foods they need with a health worker to 
give their babies the best possible start. Find out from a health 
worker about the best foods to feed growing children. Your child's 
health is your family's future. It's 21 hours 18 universal time.
