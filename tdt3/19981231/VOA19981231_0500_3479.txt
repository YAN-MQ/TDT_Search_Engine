Some drivers are being surprised by police in Angleton, Texas. The 
police are pulling over drivers who are doing a good job instead of 
giving them warnings or tickets for committing traffic violations. 
Police are giving them congratulatory letters and restaurant gift 
certificates. I don't know about you, but if I was driving down the 
street and saw a policeman pull up behind me, I would start shaking 
real bad. If I got a gift certificate to a restaurant, well. These 
drivers are being rewarded for showing courtesy to others on the road, 
for using their turn signals properly, and for wearing seat belts. 
Police gestures of good will are part of a holiday drive safe program 
in Angleton. The program began for the Christmas and New Year's season 
and continues through January 5th. Police say it can help reduce accidents 
at a time when drivers have a lot of holiday activities and responsibilities 
on their minds. Angleton police officer, Jay Bourage says a lot of 
people who were stopped by police for being good drivers are kind 
of shocked by it. Kind of shocked by it? Yeah.
