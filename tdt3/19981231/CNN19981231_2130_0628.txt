The world of science and technology saw its share of surprises in 
1998, including those that may impact your life in the new year. Ann 
Kellan looks back now at some of the highlights. I don't think it's 
gonna go anywhere because we've got him fied down tight on those things. 
From the most expensive space project to the stunning contradictions 
of a worm. The world of science and technology produced both marvels 
and mysterys in 1998. For the first time we have the complete instruction 
book, if you will, of an animal. It took researchers eight years to 
produce a detailed genetic blueprint of this worm. No one's taking 
it seriously enough. In 199, many began to worry about a threat that 
could disrupt everything from travel to banking when the next new 
year rolls ash. The so-called millennium bug could paralyze computers 
that aren't programed to read the year 2000. The government start 
add I trial to put the brakes on Microsoft's phenomenal growth and 
monopoly. He's really out to destroy Microsoft. In December, space 
walkers joined an internaksal space station. In all, 16 nations are 
building this laboratory. This is getting deeper blue, and getting 
colder and colder there. In late spring, El Nino was replaced with 
La Nina. La Nina's most devastating legacy, a busy and deadly atlantic 
hurricane season. The storm was the least understood and most abundant. 
These were once thought to be flashes of energy, but the discovery 
in Japan that these particles have maps, could alter scientists' theories 
of how the earth has changed since the big bang. Perhaps a mystery 
to be solved next year. Ann Kellan, CNN.
