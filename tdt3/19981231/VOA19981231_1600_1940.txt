Sierra Leone's information minister Julius Spencer has rejected a 
U.N. estimate that the country's rebels control the entire north of 
the country. Mr. Spencer confirmed that the key crossroads town of 
Lunsar 120 kilometers east of the capital, Freetown, had fallen to 
the rebels. He conceded West African peacekeepers had withdrawn from 
the northern capital of McKenney. Mr. Spencer said he is concerned 
about rebel infiltration toward Freetown. In the last 24 hours, there 
have been clashes north and south of the city. The United Nations 
Security Council is demanding immediate cooperation from Angola's 
Unita opposition group in the search for survivors from a U.N. chartered 
plane that crashed in Unita-controlled territory last week. VOA's 
United Nations correspondent Max Ruston reports. The council unanimously 
approved a resolution demanding that Unita leader, Jonas Sabimbie, 
provide immediate cooperation in the search and rescue of possible 
survivors from the crash. It condemns what it calls the lack of effective 
actions by all parties, especially Unita, to determine the fate of 
the passengers and crew of the aircraft. The council warns that it 
will take further action on the issue if its demands are not met. 
The C130 aircraft crashed Saturday near the provincial capital, Huambo, 
an area where intense fighting has been taking place between the government 
and Unita. On Thursday, the Angolan government said it would cooperate 
in the search for survivors. Unita has not formally responded to the 
U.N. appeals for cooperation. Max Ruston, VOA News, United Nations.
