One of the French capital's main landmarks, the Arc de Triomphe, has 
reopened to the public after striking workers settled their dispute 
with management. The workers returned to the stone arch that dominates 
Paris' main thoroughfare, the Avenue de Champs Elysees, on Thursday 
ending their five-day strike. The strikers wanted management to hire 
more staff to work at historical exhibits located inside the arc and 
to increase wages. The settlement calls for additional employees but 
it's unclear how the wage demand was addressed. The Arc de Triomphe 
attracts about 1-1/2 million visitors per year.
