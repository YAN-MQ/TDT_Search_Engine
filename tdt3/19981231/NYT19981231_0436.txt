Their visibility has soared. Their answering machines have been crammed 
with congratulations. Coach Jay Wright and the Hofstra Flying Dutchmen 
have basked for a week in their upset of Georgia Tech and a victory 
over Pennsylvania in the ECAC Holiday Festival. ``We've put ourselves 
in a position to do great things and now we have to demand a higher 
level of play from each other,'' Wright said this week after practice 
in Hempstead, N.Y. Hofstra (7-4, 1-0) resumes play Friday at New Hampshire. 
It is far from Madison Square Garden, where the Dutchmen's breakthrough 
took place, but it is the next step toward an America East Conference 
championship. A regular-season title would guarantee a home game for 
Hofstra if it advanced to the final of the conference tournament. 
A victory in the final would mean a berth in late February in the 
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, which remains 
the ultimate goal, Wright said. Hofstra has not been to the tournament 
since the 1976-77 season. Wright, who served under Rollie Massimino 
at Villanova and Nevada-Las Vegas, has guided Hofstra closer with 
every recruiting class. The Long Island university hired Wright four-and-a-half 
years ago partly because of his reputation as a recruiter. His selling 
approach is anything but slick. He cannot woo athletes with extensive 
television coverage, so he gushes about a family atmosphere and the 
school's $15 million, 5,000-seat arena, scheduled to open in January 
2000. He told his first prospects, Tim Beckett and Duane Posey, now 
seniors, that he would build a winner. He promised point guard Craig 
Claxton, who is now a junior, that he would get him more scorers to 
feed. He told the sophomores Norman Richardson and Roberto Gittens 
that he had Claxton to feed them. ``There's always been trust, but 
now that trust has materialized in the form of a championship and 
a victory over Georgia Tech,'' the 37-year-old Wright said. ``There's 
physical proof now.'' Claxton led the team in scoring at 16.3 points 
a game and assists at 7.2 last season, and was named the America East 
player of the year. The Flying Dutchmen had a 19-12 record, and tied 
for third in the conference at 11-7. This season, Claxton is averaging 
10.3 points and 5.5 assists, but his burden has been lightened by 
the maturation of the sophomores. Richardson (13.9 points) was named 
the most valuable player of the Holiday Festival after scoring 39 
points in two games, and Gittens (9.5 points, 6.1 rebounds) has become 
a steady producer at the other forward. Both fit in well in Wright's 
motion offense. The final ingredient of Hofstra's rise was not planned. 
Guard Jason Hernandez (8.5 points) transferred from New Hampshire 
after making the conference all-freshman team in 1996-97. Hernandez, 
married with a 15-month-old daughter, is from Oyster Bay, N.Y., and 
wanted to play near home. ``He gives us a leadership role that most 
of us on the team don't have,'' Richardson said. ``A lot of us are 
quiet. He's that guy that gets us fired up by talking to us, motivating 
us. With that and his basketball skills, he's just made the team that 
much better.'' Hernandez said, ``If they're diving on the floor and 
they're getting after rebounds, you know that's their way of screaming 
and yelling.'' The Flying Dutchmen got noticed last weekend with their 
victory over Georgia Tech. Their goal is holding that attention. ``Instead 
of asking me, `Why Hofstra?''' Claxton said, ``now a lot of people 
can see why Hofstra.''
