Australian expertise will be used to build a U.S. dlrs 256 million 
horse racing complex in China under a deal announced Thursday. The 
racing complex will be built in Dalian on China's northeast coast, 
Independent Victoria state member of Parliament and delegation leader 
Peter McLellan said. ``We have a memorandum of understanding to build 
a race course and we are going to provide all the expertise to do 
it,'' he said. ``It is going to happen. It is not pie in the sky. 
We have a permit from the central Chinese government to do it,'' said. 
McLellan estimated up to dlrs 61 million would flow to Victoria as 
a result of the deal. Track officials, managers, veterinarians and 
other racing experts from Victoria will visit China to train people. 
About 500 horses will also be bought from around Australia and sent 
to China. The 6,600-foot (2,000-meter) race track will be built at 
the Golden Pebble beach resort near Dalian. Work on the complex, which 
includes breeding facilities, training facilities and stables, is 
expected to start early in 1999. Introduced to China by British traders 
in the 18th Century, horse racing was promptly banned when the Communists 
seized power almost 50 years ago. But it has made a comeback. Gambling 
is still officially prohibited, but at the Beijing and Guangzhou jockey 
clubs the ban is neatly sidestepped by describing the practice as 
a ``horse racing intelligence competition.'' At the Xiang Village 
racecourse in Beijing, signs exhort patrons to observe the central 
government's instructions outlawing gambling. The signs are prominently 
displayed near the long queues of Chinese eager to lay a bet with 
the on-course bookmakers before each race.
