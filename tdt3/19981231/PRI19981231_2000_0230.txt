Sierra Leone says it forces have beaten back a rebel attack near the 
capital of Freetown. But, rebels have made significant gains in recent 
weeks and are again threatening to attack the capital. BBC's Mark 
Doyle reports. The rebels are attacking a government which came to 
power in Sierra Leone's freest and fairest elections since independence. 
The government, with support from the international community, says 
the rebels should lay down their arms. But, for now, the fighting 
continues. It's not known how many rebels or pro-government soldiers 
were killed when the rebels attacked on Wednesday just 20 kilometers 
outside Freetown, but there were fatalities. The government says the 
insurgence were routed. Mark Doyle, BBC News, Freetown.
