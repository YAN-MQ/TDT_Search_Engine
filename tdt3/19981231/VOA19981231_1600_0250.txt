Sierra Leone's information minister Julius Spencer has rejected a 
U.N. estimate that the country's rebels control the entire north of 
the country. Mr. Spencer confirmed that the key crossroads town of 
Lunsar 120 kilometers east of the capital, Freetown, had fallen to 
the rebels. He conceded West African peacekeepers had withdrawn from 
the northern capital of McKenney. Mr. Spencer said he is concerned 
about rebel infiltration toward Freetown.
