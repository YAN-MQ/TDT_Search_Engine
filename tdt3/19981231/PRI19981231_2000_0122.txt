The American embassy in Tel Aviv was closed for the day after receiving 
threats. An embassy spokesman described the threats as credible and 
specific, but gave no details. Paul Adams reports. US officials will 
not say who they think is behind this threat or whether it was directed 
against the embassy as a whole or a specific member of staff. It's 
thought the message was received last night. Ambassador Walker told 
staff not to show up for work. This is the first threat directed against 
the embassy in Tel Aviv since bombs destroyed the US mission in Nairobi 
and Delar Salem in August. The recent American-led bombing campaign 
against Iraq has also triggered fresh expressions of anti-American 
sentiment in a number of Arab capitals. Paul Adams, BBC, Jerusalem.
