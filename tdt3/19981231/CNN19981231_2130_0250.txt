U.S. and British aircraft patrolled the Iraqi no-fly zones today without 
incident. U.S. officials say forces in the Persian gulf will respond 
if threatened. Allied aircraft have been fired upon twice in the past 
three days. Tariq Aziz says the battle against aggression will continue. 
Once again, Baghdad has promised to shoot down plane naz are in its 
airspace. Iraq cannot be singled out around the globe. Out of those 
zones that were denying Iraq the right to fly its own airspace, we 
consider that as intrusion of our sovereignty, and I don't think that's 
acceptable under our international laws. So Iraq has decided to keep 
challenging those intrusions. Meanwhile, the Pentagon says the carrier 
"USS enterprise" and its battle group will leave the Persian gulf 
by the weekend. The carrier "Carl Vincent" and more than two dozen 
other ships will remain.
