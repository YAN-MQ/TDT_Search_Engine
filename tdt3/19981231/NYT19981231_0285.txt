Eric Heumann has a way with violence. In his new film, ``Port Djema,'' 
the sound of a single gunshot on the nearly empty streets of an African 
town is absolutely horrifying. Heumann conveys a suddenness and an 
immediacy to the gunfire that the average Hollywood action thriller, 
with thousands of rounds of ammunition, can't achieve. ``Port Djema'' 
has a great sense of the sinister; too bad the rest of it is so shapeless. 
Pierre Feldman (Jean-Yves Dubois), a French surgeon with better things 
to do, travels to Port Djema, a fictional African nation, because 
he made a promise to a dear friend, a doctor who was recently killed 
there. The promise was to locate one particular child and see that 
he was cared for. The film purports to have a plot, but it's only 
a riddle (who is the mystery child?), introduced briefly and almost 
immediately solved and tossed away. But Pierre does set out on the 
search, in the middle of the country's ethnic civil war, with the 
child's photograph in hand. In the process he meets a woman who photographs 
the shadows of palm trees (Nathalie Boutefeu), deals with corruption 
and life-threatening hostility and comes face to face with the country's 
desperate need for medical care, particularly for the children. Will 
Pierre stay and help or get out while the getting's good? The suspense 
about this decision lasts two minutes at most. Heumann, a producer 
of films like ``Indochine'' and ``Ulysses' Gaze,'' directed ``Port 
Djema'' and was one of its writers, along with Jacques Lebas, a French 
doctor. From 1988 to 1991, Lebas ran a humanitarian medical organization 
that did work in Lebanon, Cambodia, Romania and what was then the 
Soviet Union. He has said that one of the purposes of the film is 
to transmit ``something of the questions raised by contacts with the 
world's wounds.'' ``Port Djema'' doesn't go nearly deep enough into 
its characters or its situations for real insight, but it does have 
some lovely, artful cinematography and a heart of gold. PRODUCTION
