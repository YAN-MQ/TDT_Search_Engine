For the first time in many years, New York was not the city that recorded 
the most killings in the country last year, officials said Thursday. 
Chicago had more homicides. As the year drew to a close, Chicago officials 
said they had recorded 697 homicides in 1998, while New York City 
officials said they had recorded 628. The figures are all the more 
remarkable because New York City, with an estimated 7.3 million people, 
is so much bigger than Chicago, which has 2.7 million. New York City 
officials seized on their lower tally as cause for some celebration, 
while their counterparts in Chicago were quick to downplay its significance. 
``Chicago, which is about a third the size of New York, has I think 
about 700 homicides already,'' New York Police Commissioner Howard 
Safir noted last week. ``They're now going to have more than we have.'' 
Police Officer Cesar Guzman, a spokesman for the Chicago Police Department, 
said it would be unfair to jump to any conclusions about the relative 
safety of Chicago based on its homicide tally in one year. ``If you 
look at statistics over the last 15 years, New York has had more than 
21,000 murders since 1985; Chicago has had only 11,000,'' Guzman said. 
``New York has a police force of 40,000; we have a force of 13,500. 
You see, there are lots of factors you have to look at, not just one 
figure.'' Criminologists said New York was surpassed by Chicago in 
part because New York's murder rate is dropping faster, by about 19 
percent compared with 8 percent in Chicago. But they also noted that 
when crime rose during the crack epidemic of the late 1980s and early 
'90s, Chicago did not even come close to being as dangerous as New 
York City. ``While New York City had more than 2,000 murders a year 
in the early 1990s, Chicago never cracked a thousand,'' noted Thomas 
Repetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission in New York and 
a former commander of detectives in Chicago. ``They are not dropping 
as fast as we are, but they never rose as high as we did.'' Repetto 
pointed out that Chicago had more murders than New York in the past: 
In 1951, he said, Chicago had 249 reported killings while New York 
had 243. In 1960, he said, each city had roughly 4 percent of all 
the killings in the nation. By 1990, though, while Chicago still had 
about 4 percent of the nation's killings, New York City had almost 
10 percent. Chicagoans have not taken kindly to their home's new status 
as the city with the most homicides in the nation. Homer Munoz, 28, 
who works in the kitchen of a Chicago restaurant, said: ``You hear 
we are No. 1 in murders and you think we have to do something about 
that. I don't know what _ hire more police or something _ but it's 
scary. We have to do something.'' Others took it in stride. Arnetta 
Zellers, a candy store clerk who was born and raised in Chicago, said: 
``Chicago is a big city, so we get a lot of attention and publicity 
about murders and things like that. ``But there are smaller places 
that I think are a lot less safe _ look at Gary, Indiana,'' she said, 
referring to stubbornly high crime statistics that have plagued Gary 
for years. ``Now that's a place where I definitely wouldn't want to 
go.''
