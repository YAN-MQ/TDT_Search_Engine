A top Palestinian official said Wednesday that he expected a Palestinian 
state to be formed in 1999, but that he hoped it would be as a result 
of negotiations with Israel. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has 
made contradictory statements in recent months about whether he would 
unilaterally declare a state on May 4, the deadline for reaching a 
permanent Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to walk away from the peace talks 
and annex parts of the West Bank if Arafat goes ahead with a unilaterally 
declaration of statehood. Israeli elections are scheduled for May 
17, and it is believed that a Palestinian declaration of statehood 
on May 4 would give a boost to Netanyahu over his dovish challengers. 
Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath suggested Thursday that 
the Palestinians might be willing to hold off for a while on declaring 
a state. ``The sovereign state of Palestine will be declared in 1999, 
I have no doubt,'' Shaath told Israel army radio. ``But I still say 
that our preference is that we will finish together the permanent 
status negotiations,'' he added. Shaath said he did not want the declaration 
of a Palestinian state to become the source of problems between the 
two people. The Haaretz newspaper reported Thursday that Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak asked Arafat during recent talks to delay 
a declaration of a state so as not to interfere in the Israeli elections.
