Welcome to the last New Year's Day column of the dying millennium. 
Exciting, huh? You may have already had your last New Year's morning 
cup of coffee in this millennium. You may be watching the last Rose 
Bowl game of the fading millennium, perhaps while contemplating what 
to do (this gets tricky) on the last first weekend of the new year 
in the old millennium. Don't get too comfortable, because you will 
soon face the final opening workweek of _ you get the idea. If you 
find all this rather dreary fare, you ain't seen nothin' yet, to borrow 
from Al Jolson. The fin-de-siecle factory is just getting cranked 
up. Five will get you 10 that by mid-March you will have heard enough 
millennial references to last for _who can resist? _ 1,000 years. 
This is a good moment to become perhaps the first columnist of the 
last year of the old millennium to note that we are not really in 
the last year of the old millennium. The new millennium will not arrive 
for another two years, on Jan. 1, 2001. But almost everyone is ignoring 
that fact, and it is pointless by now to resist the obvious fascination 
with all those zeroes tumbling into place. It is a bit like watching 
a car's odometer at the 99999.9-mile mark. So brace yourself for a 
yearlong deluge of millennial musings, many of them predictable, including 
thoughts on what to call the next decade. Should the 00s be the Oughts, 
the Naughts, the Oughties, the Naughties, the Zeroes, the Zips, the 
Ohs, the Oh-Ohs, the Ooze, or even the Pre-Teens? What, then, to call 
the coming century? The year 2000 is commonly pronounced two thousand; 
2001 is two thousand and one. But where is the logic? No one refers 
to 1999 as one thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine. It is nineteen 
ninety-nine. Similarly, should we not speak of the years twenty hundred, 
twenty-oh-one, twenty-oh-two and so on? We have had 1,000 years to 
work this one out, and still time is ticking without a solution in 
earshot. And it is but one facet of the millennial machinery, which 
has steadily kicked into high gear. In 1995, for example, this newspaper 
published 303 articles with references to ``millennium,'' ``millenium,'' 
``millennial'' or ``millenial.'' The number then kept growing, to 
914 in 1998. To put that in perspective, the inescapable Monica appeared 
last year in exactly 1,000 articles. Who knows? Maybe the millennium 
is about to leave even Ms. Lewinsky in the dust. Another yardstick 
is the Manhattan phone book. The 1998-99 directory has 85 listings 
for businesses starting with variations of ``millennium.'' The 1994-95 
book had a mere 16. The current directory has 21 listings for companies 
called ``Twenty-First Century.'' Four years ago, there were nine. 
Not surprisingly, ``twentieth century'' is fading, though not right 
away at 20th Century Fox. ``At this time, there are no plans to change,'' 
said a spokeswoman, Flo Grace. But the Twentieth Century Fund, the 
public policy research institute on the Upper East Side, decided it 
could no longer swim against the tide of history. It became the Century 
Foundation a few months ago. ``There was a group of holdouts, and 
I was one of the laggards who wanted no change,'' said Richard Leone, 
the foundation's president. ``But then some asked what would people 
have thought if we had ever kept to a name like `Nineteenth Century 
Fund'? We bent to the times.'' ``By changing it to the Century Foundation,'' 
Leone added, ``nobody has to deal with this problem again.'' Fair 
enough. Instead, all of us can turn, as you know we will, to drawing 
up lists of ``the tops'' from the old millennium: best idea, best 
explorer, best invention, best book. On and on it will go, though 
you may want to be suspicious of any lineup that leaves out ``Heat 
Wave'' by Martha and the Vandellas as best rock song of the last 1,000 
years. Of course, there will be a cascade of ``predictions for the 
next millennium,'' which a couple of New Yorkers, David Kristof and 
Todd Nickerson, have compiled in a book by that very name. In it, 
some 250 prominent figures forecast everything from a planet at peace 
to global nuclear holocaust. Take your pick. Arthur C. Clarke, the 
writer of ``2001'' fame, predicts ``proof of intelligent life elsewhere'' 
will be discovered. That's encouraging. It presupposes that, prattle 
about the millennium notwithstanding, intelligent life has been found 
here.
